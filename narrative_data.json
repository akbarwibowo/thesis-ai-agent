      "title": "South Korea halts CBDC project as regulators prioritize won-backed stablecoin rollout",
      "description": "South Korea’s central bank digital currency project has been put on hold as the regulators turn their attention to fast-tracking the issuance of won-backed stablecoins. According to a Bloomberg report citing an unnamed Bank of Korea official, the central bank has suspended plans for the second phase of its CBDC pilot, which had been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. Participating banks have reportedly been informed that discussions would be temporarily paused. Authorities are reevaluating the role of a CBDC as they are pivoting toward regulating private stablecoin issuers, the official noted. The Bank of Korea had been preparing to expand its CBDC testing under “Project Han River,” which began earlier this year with a consortium of seven banks. The second phase was expected to include features such as peer-to-peer transfers and merchant payments. However, banks reportedly raised concerns over high costs and the lack of a clear commercialization plan, prompting the central bank to reassess the project’s future. Instead, the central bank will continue to monitor progress on a legislative proposal that would establish a regulatory framework for Korean won-based stablecoins. The proposed legislation, introduced under the Digital Asset Basic Act , outlines licensing requirements for issuers and includes provisions for reserve management and user protection.

Since taking office earlier this month, Lee has prioritised the institutionalisation of KRW-backed digital tokens as a strategic financial initiative. His administration supports a licensing regime that would permit companies with as little as ₩500 million ($370,000) in equity capital to issue stablecoins, subject to regulatory approval. Democratic Party leaders have framed the rollout of won-denominated stablecoins as essential to preserving South Korea’s monetary sovereignty. Party lawmakers argue that local crypto markets are overly reliant on U.S. dollar-pegged assets like USDT and USDC, and warn that continued dominance by foreign stablecoins could undermine domestic financial policy. These stablecoins reportedly accounted for over ₩57 trillion ($42 billion) in trading volume during the first quarter of 2025. Min Byeong-deok, head of the Digital Asset Committee, has warned that without swift action, Korea may lag in the race for stablecoin leadership. He contends that the market for stablecoins could surpass even artificial intelligence or semiconductors and has called for regulatory measures to support issuance by compliant entities. Commercial banks have already responding to this policy shift. Eight of the country’s largest banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, and Nonghyup, have launched a joint initiative to issue a KRW-pegged stablecoin.

      "title": "Stablecoins and Crypto Cards Gain Ground in Europe's Everyday Economy",
      "description": "Stablecoins and crypto debit cards are gaining meaningful traction in Europe’s evolving financial ecosystem, with recent data showing significant growth in both internet-based settlements and everyday spending. While stablecoins now surpass traditional card networks like Visa and Mastercard in onchain volume, crypto cards are matching — and in some areas outpacing — banks when it comes to micro-payments and online purchases. Stablecoins Leapfrog Card Giants to Become the Internet’s Default Settlement Layer The race to own the internet’s checkout button is over—for now. Data gathered by blockchain-infrastructure provider Alchemy shows that dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies have already pushed past Visa and Mastercard in on-chain transaction volume by roughly 7%, cementing stablecoins as the fastest-growing payment rail on the planet. Stablecoins have seen “explosive” adoption and are becoming the default settlement layer for the internet, Alchemy’s head of engineering Noam Hurwitz says. Behind the numbers is a simple value proposition: near-instant, borderless transfers that cost a fraction of a cent and clear 24/7—features legacy card networks still struggle to match. The result, Hurwitz added, is a decisive shift in how money moves online. PayPal, Stripe and Visa have all embedded stablecoin rails to trim costs and speed up settlement, effectively hiding the blockchain complexity behind familiar user interfaces. By leaning on Alchemy’s APIs, these firms can decouple the user experience from the underlying technology while gaining real-time finality, Hurwitz explained. A Trillion-Dollar Liquidity Pool in Treasurys One knock-on effect of stablecoin growth is a massive new buyer of US debt. Market leader Tether (USDT) generated an estimated $13 billion in profit last year and now holds roughly $113 billion in US Treasurys—more than the government of Germany. Those reserve-backed holdings anchor the broader tokenized-finance stack, Hurwitz noted, turning tokenized money into the bedrock of an emerging on-chain economy. Momentum accelerated on June 17 when the US Senate passed the bipartisan Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act). The bill creates a federal licensing regime for issuers and removes much of the legal gray area that has kept banks and payment giants on the sidelines. Industry lawyers say the legislation could be signed into law before year-end, providing a clear runway for further institutional adoption. Traditional finance isn’t standing still. J.P. Morgan’s blockchain unit Kinexys is piloting a permissioned USD deposit token—JPMD—on Coinbase’s Layer-2 network Base. The project promises interest-bearing balances, real-time liquidity and 24-hour settlement for corporate treasuries, positioning bank-issued tokens as a “superior alternative to stablecoins ” for some clients. Fragmented Chains and UX Hurdles Remain Despite eye-popping throughput, the stablecoin landscape is still fragmented across multiple blockchains. Enterprises must vet each network’s reliability, liquidity depth and counter-party risk—no trivial task for treasury teams used to a single clearing house. Hurwitz argues that the next wave of adoption will come from Layer-2 networks purpose-built for individual platforms, stitched together by seamless cross-chain bridges. However, not everyone is sold on the idea that privately issued tokens can serve as “money.” In its 2025 Annual Economic Report, the Bank for International Settlements said stablecoins fail crucial tests of singleness, elasticity and integrity, likening them to 19th-century banknotes that sometimes traded at discounts. The BIS instead backs central-bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits as safer foundations for digital finance. Layer-2s and Interoperability Alchemy expects most financial-services firms to launch their own Layer-2 chains over the next five years, each monetizing niche ecosystems while relying on stablecoins for final settlement. If cross-chain interoperability matures as quickly as liquidity has, stablecoins could underpin a more connected, always-on financial web—one where swapping tokenized dollars for tokenized securities or real-world assets happens in a single click, anywhere on Earth. Crypto Cards Challenge Banks for the Checkout Crown in Europe In related news, data from CEX.IO and other payment providers show digital-asset cards closing the gap with — and in key areas beating — traditional banks at Europe’s point of sale. Europe’s long-running love affair with cash is fading fastest at the lower end of the purchase spectrum, and crypto cards are seizing the moment. According to a 2025 spend-pattern survey released by London-based exchange CEX.IO, 45 percent of all crypto-linked card transactions in the region are for less than €10. That tiny-ticket share rivals the cozy hold cash once enjoyed at corner bakeries, newsstands and transit kiosks, and now outpaces the slice claimed by debit- and credit-card issuers backed by high-street banks. The report arrives as the number of newly issued CEX.IO cards jumped 15 percent year-to-date, hinting that Europeans are warming to the idea of spending stablecoins and mainstream crypto assets the same way they swipe or tap a bank card. Digital natives aren’t just tapping in cafés. They’re checking out online at a pace traditional cards have yet to match. While European Central Bank data show that 21 percent of all euro-area card payments are remote, CEX.IO’s customers conduct 40 percent of their transactions over the internet. The elevated e-commerce usage mirrors findings from rivals Oobit and Crypto.com, both of which have logged outsized crypto-card traffic at online retailers, airline sites and app stores. Where the Money Goes: Groceries, Dining and Daily Life Far from the crypto-luxury stereotype, most purchases are decidedly ordinary. The average crypto-card transaction clocks in at €23.70, meaning users are reaching for digital assets to buy sandwiches and detergent more often than big-ticket electronics. By comparison, Mastercard pegs the average European bank-card purchase at €33.60. Behind the scenes, stablecoins fund roughly 73 percent of purchases, confirming their rise as a low-volatility medium for everyday exchange. Yet holders still dip into more volatile assets: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Solana collectively account for a quarter of grocery, dining and transport payments in the dataset. The asset mix underscores consumers’ willingness to spend, not just hoard, their crypto. Cryptocurrencies used for purchases (Source: CEX.IO) A Cashless Future, One Tap at a Time “What we’re seeing in Europe is that crypto-card users aren’t just experimenting with new tech — they’re forming the habits that will define a truly cashless future,” said Alexandr Kerya, vice-president of product management at CEX.IO. He noted that average monthly payment volume across the company’s cardholders rose 24 percent in May alone, even as price volatility remained muted. Crypto card spending distribution (Source: CEX.IO) Those habits are reinforced by a wave of new offerings. Kraken and Mastercard launched a co-branded debit card last year; meme-coin ecosystem Floki followed suit with a 13-asset card this spring. Fintechs have responded by deepening rewards programs and upping transaction limits, hoping to keep pace with a customer base that clearly values immediate settlement and blockchain transparency. Not everyone is cheering. UK banking giant Barclays announced it will block crypto purchases on Barclaycard credit lines starting next month, citing fears of unsustainable debt loads and the absence of investor protections. The lender warned customers that digital-asset transactions fall outside the safety net of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The move signals a widening philosophical divide: fintechs lean on real-time blockchain settlement to reduce fraud and chargebacks, whereas legacy banks remain wary of an asset class still navigating regulatory scrutiny and sharp market swings. The Road to Parity — and Beyond Three trends suggest crypto cards could soon match, or surpass, traditional bank cards across more spending categories: 1. Merchant Acceptance Large payment processors now route crypto authorization through the same EMV rails they use for fiat transactions, minimizing friction for shops and restaurants. 2. Regulatory Clarity The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework rolls out this year, creating a passportable license that card issuers can leverage continent-wide. 3. Stablecoin Maturity With tokenized euros and CBDC pilots advancing, volatility concerns around crypto payments may recede, opening the door for payroll deposits and utility billing. If those forces converge, crypto cards might not just rival bank plastics for micro-spending; they could become the default in a post-cash Europe—one tap, scan or click at a time.",

      "title": "Trump criticizes Japan’s auto trade practices, calling them unfair.",
      "description": "US President Donald Trump has reignited tensions with Japan by calling their automobile trade practices “unfair” just days before steep new tariffs could be enforced. In a N ews interview aired on Sunday, Trump said the trade relationship heavily favors Japan and that the United States is getting a bad deal . “So we give Japan no cars. They won’t take our cars, right? And yet we take millions and millions of their cars into the United States. It’s not fair,” Trump said during the interview. The president emphasized that the United States and Japan recognize the trade imbalance . Trump said he had described the circumstances to Japanese officials, who accepted the problem and the fact that the United States has a large trade deficit with Japan. Trump hinted that Japan could fill the gap by increasing its purchases of American vehicles, oil and other goods. Source: Companies, MarkLines, China Automotive Technology and Research Center and Bloomberg Intelligence The US has complained for decades that Japan’s safety and emissions standards constitute so-called non-tariff barriers to American cars. Japanese automakers have flourished in the American market, but carmakers from the United States have long had difficulty penetrating the Japanese market. Tariff tensions mount as US-Japan talks race against July 9 deadline As time ticks toward the July 9 deadline, under that agreement, if the Doha talks made no progress, the US would be free to impose 25% tariffs on Japanese car imports — under a “reciprocal tariff” provision the Trump administration has championed — if there was no trade deal by then. Japan’s chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, extended his stay in Washington DC, for follow-up talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to stave off a trade rupture. The two men have had a series of discussions over the past several months in an attempt to address long-running trade irritants. On Sunday, the Japanese government released a statement describing the recent talks as productive. Akazawa and Lutnick reportedly had a “fruitful discussion” and agreed to “continue seeking a deal that benefits both the US and Japan.” However, behind-the-scenes reports suggest the talks are stuck on core issues, including how to measure market access for American cars and how Japan could offset the deficit to satisfy US demands. Despite the positive tone of the joint statement, there’s still no sign of a formal agreement or even a reprieve from the tariffs. Analysts say a failure to reach a deal could spark retaliation and damage bilateral trade relations. Trump threatens 25% tariff on Japanese cars in bold unilateral trade move Trump’s comments also signal a growing willingness to act unilaterally. He warned that the US could impose tariffs without any further discussion or approval from Japan. On Sunday, Trump said he planned to send letters to trading partners, including Japan, informing them of new tariff measures. He said he could send a letter to Japan outlining that the country would be required to pay a 25% tariff on its car exports to the United States. The blunt statement went beyond mere rhetoric. It is a continuation of what Trump believes prayerfully will be “America First” trade policies to slash the US trade deficits through the empowerment of aggressive tariff design. Trump has in the past used methods similar to those of trading partners, including China and the European Union. Critics said that threatening tariffs have tended to bring countries to the negotiating table, but it is also a strategy that could backfire by unnerving global trade.

      "description": "The post Fact Check: Did Ripple Secretly Acquire Uphold or Kraken? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In crypto, rumors travel faster than blockchain transactions and this week, a wild new one has taken over social media. Whispers are flying that Ripple might have secretly acquired a popular crypto exchange , and the community isn’t staying quiet about it. What started as a casual comment on social media has snowballed into full-blown speculation, with people connecting dots, making predictions, and trying to figure out if there’s any truth to it. And one name that has popped up several times is Uphold. So, Where Did This All Start? It kicked off when Ripple’s CEO dropped a major update about the company’s long-running legal fight with the SEC. Ripple officially announced they’re dropping their cross appeal , and the case is finally being put to rest. Naturally, this big moment got the entire crypto community talking. But what really caught people’s attention was when one of the well-known crypto exchanges jumped into the conversation on social media. A simple two-word reply from their official account was enough to send crypto Twitter into overdrive, with people speculating whether Ripple was about to acquire them. Crypto Rumors Move Fast Soon, posts and threads claiming Ripple had bought out a crypto exchange started flooding X (formerly Twitter). Even other exchanges like Kraken got casually dragged into the gossip. But one name kept popping up more than the rest, Uphold. RUMORS: DID RIPPLE JUST ACQUIRE A TOP CRYPTO EXCHANGE? NO CONFIRMATION YET — BUT THE INTERNET’S ON FIRE. IF TRUE… EVERYTHING CHANGES. #XRP #RIPPLE — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 28, 2025 Coinpedia’s Two Cents: Why Would Ripple Even Consider Buying an Exchange? Well, there’s actually a reason this rumor felt believable. Not long ago, Ripple CEO revealed they’ve got over $1 billion in cash reserves specifically set aside for expanding the company. And they’ve made it clear they don’t just want to focus on payments and liquidity anymore. Ripple’s ambitions stretch into areas like custody, compliance, and tokenization, and having an exchange under their wing would make a lot of sense down the road. That’s probably why the internet latched onto the idea so quickly. Ripple aspires to be more than just liquidity & payments. Acquisitions in crypto-friendly markets (like UAE and Switzerland), for expansion. pic.twitter.com/yTRMEasngN — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 18, 2023 Is There Any Truth to It? As of now — no. There’s no official confirmation from Ripple, Uphold, or anyone else involved. The exchange’s cheeky reply on social media seems to have been nothing more than good timing and playful interaction during a huge moment for Ripple. That said, considering Ripple’s billion-dollar war chest and their stated plans for expansion, it wouldn’t be shocking if something like this happened at some point in the future. Crypto loves a good rumor, and this one checked all the boxes, mystery, money, and a touch of drama. While it appears to be nothing more than speculation for now, it serves as a reminder that Ripple is sitting on serious resources and big ambitions.

      "description": "Asia stock markets mostly higher on Monday, following gains on Wall Street, where major U.S. indexes hit new record highs amid easing tariff risks and receding geopolitical tensions, the investors risk appetite was also boosted by developments in the U.S.-Canada trade standoff. On the geopolitical front, the ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding, easing global tensions and dampening safe-haven demand for the dollar. Gold rose to around $3,280 per ounce on Monday, helped by a weaker US dollar. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.88% to surpass 40,700, while the broader Topix Index rose 0.8% to 2,863 on Monday, with both benchmarks reaching their highest levels in nearly a year. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 144 per dollar on Monday, approaching two-week highs. Meanwhile, data showed Japan’s industrial production rose less than expected in May, as elevated US tariffs continued to dampen the outlook. However, trade friction between Japan and the US remains unresolved, as the 25% US tariff on Japanese car imports continues to be a sticking point in bilateral negotiations, with little sign of progress. Japan’s housing starts plunged 34.4% year-over-year in May 2025, sharply missing market expectations of a 14.8% drop and worsening from a 26.6% decline in the previous month. Looking ahead, investors are turning their attention to Tuesday’s Tankan survey for a clearer read on corporate sentiment and the broader economic environment. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.42% rose 0.2% to around 3,430 on Monday, snapping a two-day losing streak, as weak manufacturing data fueled expectations of additional stimulus, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.16 per dollar on Monday, recouping losses from the previous week, as the latest PMI data reinforced expectations of further stimulus measures. Official data showed China’s manufacturing PMI edged up to 49.7 in June from 49.5 but remained in contraction for a third straight month. The non-manufacturing PMI also rose slightly to 50.5, indicating tepid growth in services and construction. Beijing confirmed Friday a new trade agreement with Washington. The deal stipulates China will review export applications under its control rules, in exchange for the U.S. rolling back several restrictive measures targeting Chinese entities. Markets now await Tuesday’s Caixin PMI data for further insight into private-sector momentum. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.26% to 24,183 in Monday morning trade, extending losses for a third straight session amid broad weakness in consumer and financial stocks. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.34% to 83,797 in early trade on Monday, erasing solid gains from the prior session, as traders engaged in profit-taking after the BSE Sensex hit a record high on Friday. On the data front, India's external debt reached a record high of USD 736.3 billion in the March quarter, primarily driven by an increase in non-government debt. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.53% to 8,534 on Monday, extending last week’s gains as investor sentiment improved amid easing concerns over broad US tariffs. The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.653 on Monday. Domestically, the Melbourne Institute’s Monthly Inflation Gauge showed a modest uptick in June, reversing the previous month's decline and marking the fourth increase this year. Australia's private sector credit edged lower to 0.5% month-over-month in May 2025, compared to market expectations and the prior month's 0.7%. Investors now await Australia’s June manufacturing PMI for insights into the health of the sector and the country's overall economic momentum. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher amid optimism for trade deals and rate cut hopes, overshadowing Trump's Canada trade talk comments. On the economic front, investors are closely watching key US labor market indicators this week, including job openings data, the ADP employment report, and the non-farm payrolls report, which could provide further insights into the Federal Reserve's rate path. U.S. stock futures rose on Monday as Wall Street aimed to close out a strong June, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new all-time highs: Dow +0.57% ; S&P 500 +0.39% ; Nasdaq +0.55% . Currencies: ( JPY:USD ), ( CNY:USD ), ( AUD:USD ), ( INR:USD ), ( HKD:USD ), ( NZD:USD ).

      "description": "The post Can Pi Network Hit $10 by December 28? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network’s price fell over the weekend, dropping to $0.532, down 20% from last week’s high and 56% down from its May peak. This decline has pushed its market cap below $4 billion, despite several big updates on Pi Day 2. Pi’s Price Drops Despite Major Updates The Pi Core Team announced new features, including an AI initiative, upgrades to the Pi App Studio, and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system that lets users stake Pi to boost app visibility. Other highlights included integration with Onramper, a new Pi Wallet upgrade, and Node version 0.5.2 with improved security. The price still failed to rally as no exchange listing was announced, and concerns such as the upcoming token unlocks and the project’s centralized control have yet to be resolved. Token Unlocks Threaten to Add $215M in Sell Pressure Between late June and July 2025, approximately 276 million Pi tokens, representing about 3.7% of the circulating supply, are set to be unlocked. This will introduce over $215 million in sell pressure to the market. Historically, similar token unlocks have led to major price declines, ranging from 30% to 77%, and there is a strong possibility this pattern could repeat.

With the absence of these factors, Pi is at risk of falling further or staying flat near its current lows. Big Move Expected In The Year-End The next big day is scheduled for December 28, 2025 (Pi Year-End Summary Day), which is still several months away. If no strong market catalyst emerges in the near term, then a strong rebound appears unlikely. According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is set for a bullish second half of 2025. It may start around $1.20 in July and reach up to $2.80 by December. It may see a small dip in September before picking up again. Pi Coin Short-Term Price Prediction Pi Network started the month around $0.70 and dropped steadily, hitting a low around $0.42 mid-month. Around June 24-26, the price surged near $0.66 before falling again. Currently, it is trading around $0.52, a level that has been tested multiple times and may act as short-term support. However, Pi Coin could be setting up for a bounce. It recently broke out of a bullish falling wedge pattern and is now retesting the breakout level. If momentum builds, the next target could be the key $1 mark.",

      "description": "As the market’s second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), struggles to maintain momentum above the crucial $2,500 threshold, one analyst believes that ETH is poised for a significant rally. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. “Most doubt ETH and altcoins right now—I’m betting on $4,000 this summer,” he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop’s analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",

      "title": "3 Things That Could Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Markets in Week Ahead",
      "description": "US stock markets surged last week, with major indexes approaching all-time highs on the easing of tensions in the Middle East and rising hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year. Crypto markets were a little slower to react, remaining mostly flat over the past week and into the weekend. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, showed that price increases accelerated in May, raising inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he expects to see a pickup in inflation this summer, but reiterated his “wait and see” approach. On Sunday, President Trump commented on the July 9 deadline for the 90-day tariff pause, stating, “I don’t think I need to extend it, but could.” Economic Events June 30 to July 4 June’s ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday. This report shows business conditions in the manufacturing sector and serves as a significant leading indicator of overall economic conditions. There are also job openings data due on Tuesday, which could reflect conditions in the labor market. Wednesday and Thursday will see more labor market reports, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment figures released. These reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. They are significant economic indicators, as the shift in the number of jobs is strongly associated with overall economic health. June’s ISM Services PMI, due on Thursday, will reflect business conditions in the services sector and is another leading economic indicator. Traditional markets are closed on Friday for the July 4 celebrations as we enter the second half of the year. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markets remained flat over the weekend but gained during early Asian trading on Monday morning to reach $3.46 trillion in total capitalization. Bitcoin has reached a two-week high, tapping $108,750 in early trading on Monday, but it faced resistance there yet again and fell back to $108,500 at the time of writing. The assed has struggled at this level at least five times over the past week where it has been rejected. Ethereum is doing a little better, having reached its support-turned-resistance level of $2,500 on Monday morning after a 2.8% gain. The altcoins were mostly in the green with minor gains, but Hyperliquid (HYPE) was leading the pack, adding 7.5% on the day to top $40.

      "title": "BNB Chain rolls out Maxwell hardfork to reduce block time and enhance network responsiveness",
      "description": "Cryptocurrencies displayed strength over the weekend as Bitcoin extended above $105,000 to press time’s $108,568. While altcoins brace for significant bounce-backs, BNB Chain will officially roll out the Maxwell hardfork today, June 30, 2025. The upgrade aims to enrich Binance’s chain through enhanced efficiency and speed. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN · Follow ⚠️ Maxwell Hardfork goes live in a few hours, here’s everything you need to know 🧵 👇 8:24 PM · Jun 29, 2025 130 Reply Copy link Read 56 replies First and foremost, Maxwell will halve BSC’s block time to only 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds, making it a sub-second platform. It’s noteworthy that today’s fork builds on last year’s Lorentz upgrade momentum, reflecting the team’s continued dedication to scalability, speed, and enriched user experience. BSC’s journey to efficiency: from Loretz upgrade to Maxwell BNB Chain is among the blockchain projects that take speed as a foundational element for success in the sector. It rolled out the Lorentz fork in April 2025 to reduce block times from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The update brought noticeable enhancement across validator efficiency, dApp responsiveness, and DeFi performance. BNB Chain flourished after Lorentz. For instance, it delivered only a $0.04 transaction fee. Moreover, Dune’s data shows BSC outshined all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in daily volume. Source – Dune Analytics Meanwhile, the Maxwell upgrade will take these advancements to another level. Node operators, developers, and users can anticipate smooth app interactions and swift transaction confirmations. What to expect with Maxwell hardfork? The latest upgrade transforms BNB Smart Chain’s ecosystem with three main improvements. Firstly, it introduces BEP-524 to slash the block interval to 0.75 seconds. That means doubling BSC’s transaction throughput capability. Users will enjoy accelerated offerings from minting and token swaps to smart contract execution and GameFi activities. Secondly, Maxwell enhanced validator messaging by enhancing existing p2p communication models. That will reduce possible syncing lags, boosting network stability even during faster activities. Validators will experience fewer delays when proposing and voting on blocks. Finally, the BPE-564 standard introduces two messaging mechanisms, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg. These will enable nodes to synch massive block groups at once, enriching syncing speed and reliability across the BSC network. The Maxwell update isn’t about boosting speed alone. It represents a strategic step toward a more efficient and faster blockchain future. The upgrade reflects BSC’s dedication to dominating web3 adoption amid renewed demand for responsive performance in NFTs, DeFi, and online gaming. BNB price outlook The native token displayed bullishness as enthusiasts brace for network enhancements. BNB trades at $655 after rebounding from the support at $642. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its increasing daily trading volume suggests a possible upward continuation. Continued bullishness amid the Maxwell upgrade and broad market uptrends could fuel BNB’s price to the next resistance at $720. A breakout might propel the token to the crucial obstacle at $760, beyond which BNB will shift its trajectory to bullishness. However, sudden selling pressure might cause the token to plunge to the support barrier at $520-$540.

      "title": "Why XRP, Ethereum, and Avalanche Traders Are Now Watching MAGACOIN FINANCE Closely for 2025 Gains",
      "description": "Crypto investors are no strangers to rotating capital in search of the next big wave—and in 2025, that rotation is pointing toward a bold new presale: MAGACOIN FINANCE. What started as a politically branded, community-first token has quickly become one of the most closely watched opportunities in the early-stage altcoin market. Now, traders from legacy ecosystems—especially XRP, Ethereum, and Avalanche—are paying attention. Despite the long-term potential of those established chains, many holders are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, lured by its capped supply, rapid presale growth, and aggressive upside projections. For those seeking asymmetric gains before the next altcoin run kicks into full gear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a serious contender. Why the Rotation From XRP, ETH, AVAX Is Happening Now The story begins with timing. XRP has made major strides this year, thanks in part to ETF speculation and a strengthened regulatory outlook. But after a strong rally, price action has cooled into a consolidation phase. Ethereum, despite rolling out long-awaited upgrades, has also seen sideways movement as staking yields normalize and institutional adoption stabilizes. Meanwhile, Avalanche is working through its own recovery after a price dip earlier this year, but momentum remains tepid In a market built on momentum and narrative, that lull is prompting traders to look elsewhere. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering just the right combination of novelty and promise. Its presale is filling rapidly. Some analysts are forecasting 25x to 50x returns from current levels, placing it in the same conversation as early Shiba Inu or Solana—projects that were once overlooked, then exploded. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings structure. Its token supply is capped at 170 billion. Smart contracts have been audited. And perhaps most importantly, there’s no VC control—the ownership model is entirely community-driven. This transparency is catching the eye of seasoned traders, particularly those weary of dilution, slow roadmaps, or centralized decision-making in older Layer-1 ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s setup mirrors some of the best traits from previous breakout tokens—community energy, early access pricing, and a narrative that’s generating attention on crypto Twitter and beyond. Utility and Listings on the horizon While most meme-inspired tokens lack long-term strategy, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with plans for a referral-based incentive model and a clear roadmap aimed at encouraging long-term holding and participation. These features are already drawing interest from Ethereum and Avalanche traders who are used to earning yield through protocol engagement—and now see early-stage entry into MAGACOIN FINANCE as a more asymmetric bet with significantly higher upside. Community growth has also been exponential, fueled by politically charged branding and a meme-forward marketing strategy. But this isn’t a one-dimensional campaign—exchange listings are reportedly on the horizon. And that’s where traders are hoping to catch the next big move. Historically, some of the most explosive gains in crypto come just before or after a token’s first major exchange debut. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be sitting right at that inflection point. The Asymmetric Opportunity For XRP, ETH, and AVAX traders, the calculus is simple. These are powerful projects with massive potential—but at their current valuations, they’re unlikely to deliver 30x returns in a single cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, still sits in the early innings. That’s what makes it attractive to experienced investors who understand risk but are ready to reposition for a bigger swing. This isn’t about abandoning blue chips—it’s about timing. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the story, structure, and speed to justify the attention it’s getting.

      "title": "Why is Bitcoin Stuck at $100,000 and Not Rising? Analyst Explains the Real Reason",
      "description": "Charles Edwards, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Capriole Investments, made remarkable statements about the stagnation in the Bitcoin price and recent market dynamics. According to Edwards, the reason Bitcoin is stuck at $100,000 levels despite the interest (FOMO) from institutional investors is due to selling pressure from long-term investors. Edwards stated that since the spot ETF launch in January 2024, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have been selling to Wall Street and liquidating their positions. Stating that this situation is reflected in the media in different ways, Edwards argued that the real reason is these sales. The CEO recalled a prediction he made in April, saying that companies holding Bitcoin treasury would create a “flywheel” effect, triggering a massive buying wave in the market and pushing the ETF narrative to the background. Edwards said that this effect is now clearly visible and many new companies are joining this trend. Related News: Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released - Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends Examining on-chain data, Edwards explained that there has been a huge increase in the number of investors holding BTC for more than 6 months in the last two months, and that the purchases made by this group more than covered all the BTC sold by LTHs in the last 1.5 years. He evaluated this situation as “incredible.” Edwards also stated that such aggressive increases are usually followed by price squeezes, which is a short-term bullish sign. However, Edwards noted that there is still some weakness in the general on-chain data, and stated that recovery is possible if this buying momentum continues: “Can Treasury companies continue this rapid pace of buying? I think this cycle is just beginning. If aggressive buying by investors with a 6-month holding continues, the market could overcome this weakness.” *This is not investment advice.

      "title": "BTC Could Surge as Youth Lose Faith in Traditional Finance",
      "description": "Market strategist Jordi Visser argues that economic disillusionment among younger generations, combined with rapid advancements in AI and automation, will erode faith in traditional capitalist models and fuel demand for decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Former President Donald Trump also weighed in by praising Bitcoin’s role in alleviating pressure on the US dollar and subtly referencing the Triffin Dilemma. This is a core flaw in the dollar’s global reserve status. Meanwhile, Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein pointed out Bitcoin’s use as a shield against authoritarian control due to its censorship-resistant qualities and historical utility in pro-democracy movements. With increasing distrust in fiat currencies, ballooning government debt, and weakening institutional credibility, all of these narratives come together to present Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a growing pillar in both economic realignment and individual empowerment. Younger Generations Turning to Bitcoin Market analyst Jordi Visser offered a provocative outlook on the future of Bitcoin, and suggested that the disillusionment of younger generations with the existing economic order could be a major force behind the cryptocurrency’s long-term price appreciation. On a recent episode of entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s podcast, Visser said that people aged 25 and younger are becoming increasingly skeptical of capitalism and are instead advocating for a new system rooted in greater public spending and expansive social benefits. This generational shift, he argues, is being fueled by economic uncertainty, the erosion of trust in traditional institutions, and the looming threat of widespread job displacement caused by artificial intelligence. According to Visser, the growing frustration and lack of faith in the current system are prompting governments to ramp up spending to try and placate the masses—an action that inevitably leads to more money printing. He believes that this ongoing reliance on fiat currency and debt-driven economics will only strengthen the case for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. “The more people are angry, the more money the government has to print,” Visser explained. This cycle of monetary expansion will drive Bitcoin’s price higher over time, regardless of public perception or institutional resistance. He predicts that Bitcoin will increasingly replace fiat assets as it becomes a more trusted financial instrument. AI protest Visser also issued a broader warning about the long-term viability of capitalism itself. He suggested that the rapid development of AI and robotic technologies—especially humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles—could make human labor obsolete, further concentrating wealth in the hands of a few and destabilizing the capitalist framework. He believes this technological shift is imminent, with commercial adoption of self-driving cars and robotic labor likely within five years. These kinds of advancements, he said, will act as a wake-up call for society. He beieleves it will force a reevaluation of existing economic models and accelerate interest in decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Trump Says Bitcoin Eases Pressure on the Dollar President Donald Trump also recently expressed his strong support for Bitcoin by praising its growing role in the US economy during a White House press conference on Friday. Trump described the cryptocurrency industry as “amazing,” due to its job creation potential and increasing use as a means of payment. He suggested that Bitcoin helps relieve pressure on the US dollar, a statement that digital asset researcher Anders X believes alludes to the Triffin Dilemma. This is a long-standing economic conflict where the issuer of the world’s reserve currency must sacrifice domestic monetary stability to meet global demand for liquidity. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the United States is required to maintain persistent trade deficits in order to supply enough dollars to the global market. While this practice supports international trade and provides a short-term solution to global liquidity needs, it undermines the long-term value of the dollar due to ongoing money creation. This systemic contradiction fuels concerns about currency debasement and inflation. Trump’s previous comments about potentially paying off national debt with Bitcoin means that there is a growing awareness of the contrast between the inflation-prone dollar and Bitcoin’s capped supply. Critics, however, point out that even if the US Treasury were to acquire the entire Bitcoin supply, it would fall far short of covering the nation’s ballooning $37 trillion debt . With deficits continuing to rise, many analysts believe this debt trajectory is unsustainable and could ultimately lead to a collapse in the dollar’s value. Macroeconomist Lyn Alden captured this sentiment with the now-famous phrase “nothing stops this train.” This reflects the consensus that governments will continue printing money indefinitely. This pessimism is already playing out in financial markets. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of other major currencies, recently fell to its lowest level in three years. At the same time, US government bond yields are still elevated, which signals weakening investor confidence in the government’s ability to manage its debt responsibly. Bitcoin Rescues People From Tyranny At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein addressed a room of American political leaders, and talked about Bitcoin’s critical role in countering authoritarian regimes. Gladstein pointed out that Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful financial tool for people living under oppressive governments by offering a decentralized alternative to state-controlled fiat systems. According to him, when used correctly—without tying personal identity to transactions—Bitcoin makes it a lot harder for governments to monitor, freeze, or seize individual assets. Gladstein stated that one of Bitcoin’s most valuable features is its resistance to manipulation by authoritarian leaders. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be inflated or weaponized to exert control over citizens, Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated, and self-custodied wallets remain outside the reach of state interference. “If you’re self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you,” he said. He shared that the Human Rights Foundation first recognized Bitcoin’s potential during Ukraine’s 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Protesters at the time faced frozen bank accounts, yet Bitcoin provided a way to receive financial support when traditional banking systems failed. Despite initial skepticism—Bitcoin was valued at just $100 then—the technology proved very effective when it came to delivering funds across borders and into the hands of those fighting for democratic freedoms. Gladstein concluded that Bitcoin already helped countless people escape the financial reach of authoritarian governments and continues to do so. Since joining the Human Rights Foundation in 2007, he saw firsthand how the technology empowers people in regions where human rights are regularly violated. According to him, Bitcoin is not just a technological innovation but a tool for resistance, making it, as he put it, “bad for dictators.”",

      "description": "Vanadi Coffee, a cafe chain with six outlets in Spain, has announced that stakeholders have approved a €1 billion ($1.17 billion) Bitcoin investment plan, in a move to “redefine” its business model. The company reported a loss of €3.3 million ($3.86 million) in 2024, a 15.8% increase from the previous year. As a result, the beleaguered Vanadi has pivoted to a shift in its strategy, adopting Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. “Vanadi Coffee has adopted a number of financial instruments to support its Bitcoin strategy since last April and will use Bitcoin as a strategic store of value in its new business model,” the coffee chain said in an official announcement . Vanadi Coffee’s Billion-Euro BTC Play The coffee chain has taken its cue from major international players that are betting big on a similar BTC strategy, including Saylor’s Strategy and Japanese Metaplanet . The company said that it is aiming to accumulate “large amounts of Bitcoin” as part of its treasury. Further, it said that Bitcoin investment is a long-term commitment. “Vanadi Coffee is diversifying its business into Bitcoin investment and management and other cryptocurrency-related areas,” the coffee chain noted. Further, the firm aims to create a strategic window for investors, given the scarcity of BTC treasury companies listed in Spain and EU markets.

It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6000. Today… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 30, 2025 He shared his regret about not buying more gold, silver, and Bitcoin earlier. He blames his hesitation on being too focused on fiat money, which he calls “fake money.” He also reflected on how many people regret not chasing their dreams, especially later in life. Buying Bitcoin at $107K Now that Bitcoin trades around $107,000, Kiyosaki acknowledges the same feeling, thinking it’s too expensive. Yet, he’s still buying more. His reasoning is quite simple, as he explains that if Bitcoin hits $1 million, he knows he’ll look back on today’s price and feel the same regret for not buying more. That’s why he urges people to stop obsessing over price tags and instead pay attention to how much of an asset they own. He believes poor people tend to focus too much on price, while the wealthy focus on accumulating quantity. Whether it’s gold, silver, or Bitcoin, Kiyosaki says he doesn’t worry about daily price swings. For him, the key is building up holdings over time, not trying to time the perfect entry. Power on One Satoshi Kiyosaki encouraged even small investors to participate. Even if someone can only afford one Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, he believes they’ll be grateful in five years. In his view, a Satoshi bought today could carry significant value in the future. Based on historical trends, if Bitcoin continues to double in price every 4–5 years, even a small investment could yield big returns. A 2023 MIT study found that adding crypto assets to a portfolio could reduce long-term risk by up to 15%. Although he doesn’t claim to know whether Bitcoin will reach $1 million, Kiyosaki made it clear that in hindsight, every previous price point feels like a bargain. He describes the $107,000 Bitcoin as “priceless,” emphasizing the long-term potential of the asset rather than its current cost.",

      "description": "Dogecoin started a fresh increase above the $0.160 zone against the US Dollar. DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for a move above $0.1680. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1520 and $0.160 levels. The price is trading above the $0.1620 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1650 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh decline if it stays below the $0.1680 zone. Dogecoin Price Faces Resistance Dogecoin price started a fresh increase above the $0.1450 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE was able to climb above the $0.1550 and $0.160 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.1650 resistance. A high was formed at $0.1699 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1572 swing low to the $0.1699 high.

      "title": "XRP and Cardano (ADA) Price Outlook 2025: Can This New Altcoin Outperform Both Before 2026?",
      "description": "As the 2025 crypto cycle gains traction, analysts are revisiting some of the market’s most followed altcoins — particularly XRP and Cardano (ADA). Both are positioned for long-term relevance, but short-term headwinds and broader market shifts are pushing investors to seek new narratives. Among the rising contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most discussed tokens in institutional research circles. XRP Approaches Regulatory Clarity and ETF Speculation XRP continues to capture institutional interest, especially as legal uncertainty winds down. With regulatory breakthroughs in Canada and positive momentum toward a U.S. spot ETF approval, analysts view XRP as entering a maturing phase. However, this maturity also brings slower, more measured growth expectations. Much of the anticipated upside is now seen as tied to ETF developments and macro adoption curves. While XRP’s long-term fundamentals remain intact, short-term gains may be more constrained as capital seeks more agile, high-leverage opportunities. Cardano Aims to Reclaim Developer Momentum Cardano’s journey in 2025 has been shaped by network upgrades and renewed efforts to attract developers and dApp ecosystems. Despite its academic foundation and proven sustainability model, Cardano continues to face questions about real-world traction and user adoption rates. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic but note that Cardano’s price trajectory is increasingly linked to execution. In a fast-moving market, the slow-and-steady approach may offer resilience, but it doesn’t always deliver the explosive returns sought by early-phase investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises as a High-Upside Play While XRP and Cardano lean on established infrastructures, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating attention for its rare early-entry profile, scarcity-focused design, and rising traction across independent research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and interest continues to grow among early-stage investors seeking asymmetric upside. What differentiates MAGACOIN FINANCE is its strategic positioning: analysts see it as a token designed for structural momentum, not just cyclical waves. As capital rotates across the crypto space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being identified as a standalone force that benefits from emerging macro trends, narrative cycles, and scarcity dynamics. With a model that rewards timing and strategic entry, it has carved out a space in portfolios seeking high-range forecasts over the next market leg. Final Thoughts The 2025 landscape is filled with both proven altcoins and promising newcomers. XRP and Cardano maintain their foundational roles, but the next breakout opportunities are increasingly being found in lesser-known assets with high-leverage potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of strategic positioning, investor interest, and market narrative alignment. For those recalibrating their portfolios ahead of 2026, this emerging token offers a rare entry window that analysts say could deliver meaningful upside — especially as traditional altcoins trend sideways or consolidate. In a market driven by timing and positioning, the smart money is already watching where the next wave is forming.

      "title": "$3.95B XRP Futures Surge in 24H — Is Institutional FOMO Kicking In?",
      "description": "XRP has suddenly taken center stage in the crypto market, with a jaw-dropping $3.95 billion in futures trading volume recorded in just 24 hours. This dramatic spike is raising eyebrows across the industry — especially among analysts watching for signs of institutional involvement. Could this be the early tremor of a larger wave of investment interest? Let’s dive into what this surge might mean for XRP and the broader altcoin market. XRP Hovers with Cautious Optimism as Bulls Await Stronger Signals Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a little over $2 and $2.30, indicating cautious trading sentiment. Bulls are finding it hard to push past the $2.45 resistance, suggesting bears have some control. However, support exists just below $2, offering a safety net. Over the past month, XRP has fallen by just over 10%, hinting at potential for a rebound. If momentum shifts, XRP could aim for the $2.70 mark, marking a 17% rise from the current upper range. The RSI hovers near 52, indicating a balanced market, while the MACD is slightly negative. Overall, XRP's short-term potential hinges on breaking resistance, offering promising growth if bulls gain strength. Conclusion The $3.95 billion surge in XRP futures is more than just a number — it’s a signal. Whether it stems from institutional FOMO or renewed speculative interest, the momentum behind XRP is building at a critical technical juncture. If bulls can overcome the current resistance zones, the path toward $2.70 and beyond becomes increasingly realistic. For now, all eyes remain on XRP as it dances between caution and potential breakout. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

      "title": "With 18,200+ Miners Sold, BlockDAG Ignites a New Mining Era! BNB Drops & NEAR Stalls",
      "description": "This week has been hard for Binance, and the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows it clearly with a big fall. The chart is flashing warning signals after dropping sharply. At the same time, Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum is slowing down, with traders focusing on support levels as bearish patterns remain firm. On a separate note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is seeing massive growth by making mining easy on phones. More than 2 million people now use its app for mining, and 18,200 hardware miners have been sold, making BlockDAG stand out among popular crypto coins for its easy mining setup. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Chart Hints at More Weakness Ahead Looking at the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows a clear fall in mood. Its price fell from $697.55 on May 27 to nearly $600 now. Even with an 8% rise in stablecoin transactions, which are now over $749 billion on BSC, BNB stays under selling pressure. Charts hint at a deeper fall as it broke main support and formed a head-and-shoulders pattern. On the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart, RSI and Stochastic Oscillator readings show sellers still lead. Support could hold near $500, but a longer-term recovery remains possible. Near Protocol (NEAR) Price Momentum Weakens More Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum remains negative despite a sudden 90% rise in trading volumes. The token has dropped to $1.89, a 15% weekly decline, showing the bearish mood stays strong. All major EMAs are pointing down, hinting that weakness may continue. Resistance is mild near $2.15, while $1.98 support is closely watched as a possible breakdown mark. No strong triggers are seen, keeping Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum firmly weak, although some traders bet on quick rebounds. Unless the overall market lifts, downside pressure may keep rising. BlockDAG Hits 18,200 Miners Sold & 2M Users as Mining Demand Skyrockets BlockDAG is changing mining by making it easy for everyone. Its X1 Miner App now has over two million users mining BDAG on their phones. Alongside, 18,200 X-Series miners have been sold, proving strong demand for both phone and hardware mining. The miner range offers options for all types of users. For those starting small, the X10 fits well, while the X30 and X100 are for higher daily BDAG returns. Whether one is testing it out or building a full setup, BlockDAG gives simple tools for every plan without adding confusion. The next shipments are set for July 7 for X30 and X100 , and August 15 for X10. These devices can mine up to 600 and 2,000 BDAG per day. They focus on performance while staying quiet and compact. Rising sales show users want easy ways to scale mining without problems. BlockDAG’s coin is gaining attention, too. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, with prices rising from $0.001 to $0.0276. Currently, the coin is priced at $0.0080 as a limited-time offer, drawing interest from those hunting early gains. A total of 23.3 billion coins have been sold, with presale funding over $324 million toward the $600 million aim. As more miners join and devices ship out, BlockDAG is getting compared with other popular crypto coins, and talks of a $10 future price keep circulating, keeping its spotlight strong. Final Verdict! Recent weakness on the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart signals caution, with sellers still strong. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) price momentum remains downbeat, with no clear lift seen. Both may need strong triggers for recovery. On the other hand, BlockDAG moves ahead with over 2 million miners, 18,200 devices sold, and its coin at just $0.0080 as a limited-time offer. With more devices coming and growing use, BlockDAG is shaping up as more than just another name; it is among the top popular crypto coins to track before prices climb and the window closes.

      "description": "Signs of green shoots have emerged in the shiba inu SHIB market, with whale accumulation and an inside week candle suggesting a price recovery ahead. SHIB's price has dropped nearly 27% to $0.00001160 since mid-May, hitting a 16-month low of $0.00001005 at one point, according to data source TradingView. The decline, however, prompted whales – investors with ample capital supply and ability to move markets – to go bargain hunting. These entities recently purchased 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens worth approximately $110 million, according to CoinDesk's AI insights. Meanwhile, prices bounced 11% in the seven days to June 29, forming an \"insider week\" candle, signaling a pause in the downtrend. The pattern occurs when the trading range (high- low) of a weekly candle is entirely contained within the range of the preceding weekly candle. It's a sign of indecision, with both buyers and sellers unwilling to lead the price action. The occurrence of the said candlestick pattern after a prolonged downtrend, as in SHIB's case, is said to represent seller exhaustion and a potential for an upward price swing. Key points SHIB experienced a 4.3% price swing from $0.00001147 to $0.00001198 during the 24-hour period from 29 June 04:00 to 30 June 03:00. Most significant price action occurred between 21:00-22:00 on 29 June, when SHIB broke out of its consolidation pattern on 5.8x above-average volume. High-volume resistance established at $0.00001198, with subsequent profit-taking leading to support at the $0.00001160 level. 24-hour closing price of $0.00001164 represented a 1.4% gain from the opening level. In the last 60 minutes from 30 June 02:53 to 03:52, SHIB dropped 0.3% from $0.00001167 to $0.00001164. Two distinct phases marked the hourly period: an initial sharp decline to $0.00001056 between 03:17-03:28, followed by a recovery attempt peaking at $0.00001165 around 03:45. Volume spikes exceeding 8 million USDT occurred during key reversal points at 03:35 and 03:49, suggesting institutional positioning.",

      "title": "Smart Investors Are Watching Cardano (ADA), but a $0.03 Token May Deliver the Next 20×",
      "description": "The post Smart Investors Are Watching Cardano (ADA), but a $0.03 Token May Deliver the Next 20× appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Cardano (ADA) continues to hold investor attention as a fundamentally sound project, many seasoned traders are quietly pivoting toward early-stage tokens with more aggressive upside. One of the standout names emerging in these circles is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi lending protocol currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, with 50% of the tokens already sold. Its structured presale is progressing rapidly, with each phase bringing a higher price, ultimately reaching $0.06 by Phase 11. But what’s setting MUTM apart isn’t just its low entry point—analysts featured on Cointelegraph and Investing.com have already highlighted the project as a potential category leader in decentralized lending, citing its strong audit scores, early product rollout, and robust lending mechanics. If the token reach its projected listing valuations of $0.60 or higher, early entries could realize 20x gains from this level. A $1,500 investment today could grow to $30,000, aligning with the kinds of returns typically associated with the earliest backers of Cardano (ADA) or Polkadot (DOT). With analysts drawing such parallels this early on, it’s easy to see why sharp capital is already positioning. Custom Lending Beyond ADA’s Scope Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a liquidity model that stands apart from static DeFi protocols. Rather than offering a singular lending approach, it will implement both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending systems, giving users the freedom to lend or borrow based on their preferred structure. The P2C system will allow users to earn interest through pooled liquidity, while P2P will enable direct, custom agreements that are particularly attractive for institutions, large holders, or users holding tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Pepe (PEPE)—assets not traditionally supported in pooled DeFi setups. Unlike ADA, which never offered a lending product that gives users full control over loan terms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will let lenders and borrowers negotiate rates and collateral structures in the P2P model. This flexibility enables smarter capital deployment and appeals to investors who want utility beyond staking. Borrowers will retain full ownership of their assets by posting collateral, unlocking liquidity without losing exposure to their holdings—a major advantage during bull cycles or portfolio restructuring. The P2C mechanism will also be dynamic, with interest rates adjusting automatically based on the utilization of liquidity pools. As demand for borrowing rises, interest rates will climb, incentivizing more lenders to join the pool. This self-correcting system keeps the ecosystem balanced without manual intervention, and it creates yield opportunities far more responsive than what legacy networks like Cardano (ADA) offer. Revenue-Backed Rewards and Long-Term Growth Mechanics Mutuum’s model of generating yield will center around mtTokens, which will represent a user’s share in the liquidity pools. These tokens will accumulate value in real time, automatically reflecting interest earned. Stakers who stake mtTokens in designated contracts will be eligible for protocol-funded dividends, issued in the form of buybacks of the native MUTM token. These buybacks will use actual protocol revenue—giving rewards real financial backing rather than being inflation-based. This makes Mutuum’s staking model far more sustainable than token rewards funded by pre-mines or treasuries. As usage of the protocol scales, so too will the value generated and redistributed to stakers, turning mtTokens into passive-income tools that automatically grow with protocol activity. ADA holders have long been used to staking with flat returns, but MUTM will tie its staking incentives directly to ecosystem health and on-chain utilization, offering an entirely different trajectory of value accrual. In addition to protocol mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also laying the groundwork for scalability with a future Layer-2 integration plan. This will reduce transaction fees and support faster, more efficient lending and staking operations—something ADA has faced significant criticism for lacking even after years of development. As Mutuum continues to expand, Layer-2 compatibility will play a crucial role in broadening its adoption, particularly among users priced out of Ethereum mainnet fees. Beyond development, the $100K giveaway launched by the team signals a bold approach to community acquisition. Instead of relying solely on traditional paid marketing, the project is actively rewarding users who participate early. This not only encourages word-of-mouth momentum but also ensures the community grows alongside the protocol’s development. ADA has never prioritized this level of direct user reward during its formative stages, which makes MUTM’s strategy feel more aligned with current crypto user expectations. At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits in Phase 5 of its presale—and 50% of this allocation is already sold. With the token set to list at $0.06, the current entry point offers a clean 2x upside before public markets even open. But the bigger picture isn’t just about presale pricing—it’s about entering a project that’s engineered for utility, yield, and long-term value capture. With 11 phases in total and each step increasing in price, latecomers will face higher costs and a tighter margin for gains.

      "description": "Nobitex exchange, Iran’s largest cryptocurrency platform, has begun restoring wallet access to users following a major exploit that resulted in more than $90 million in losses. The company issued an update on June 29 via X, outlining a phased recovery process starting with verified users. According to the statement, only spot wallets are being unlocked initially, with other wallet types to follow once identity verification is completed. Users are being asked to wait for confirmation before attempting to access their balances, which will be displayed gradually as the security checks proceed. Follow- up on Nobitex Security Incident, Step-by-step wallet access has begun, 29 June 2025 Please note: 1.

The identity… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 29, 2025 “Once the accuracy and security of all information is confirmed, Nobitex will begin displaying wallet balances in phases,” the exchange wrote. Nobitex expects the process to finish by mid-week but noted that timelines could shift based on technical and security considerations. The exploit , carried out on June 18, was claimed by Gonjeshke Darande, a pro-Israel group also known as Predatory Sparrow. Blockchain investigators say roughly $90–100 million in digital assets were drained from hot wallets across Ethereum ( ETH ) and Tron ( TRX ), including Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ).

The firm warned users not to deposit funds into previously used addresses, noting that any deposits to old wallets may result in permanent loss. “If your old deposit address is connected to a mining rig or saved as a default withdrawal address in a blockchain service, make sure to delete it an,” the update advised, stressing the risk of sending funds to invalid wallets. The hackers reportedly accessed the platform using employee credentials compromised earlier via infostealer malware. The breach exposed parts of Nobitex’s internal systems, including source code and server data, which were later leaked online. Nobitex, which has processed more than $11 billion in inflows to date, holds a dominant position among Iran-based exchanges. Chainalysis has previously linked it to illicit activities by ransomware groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and sanctioned Russian entities. With user access gradually resuming and trading features still disabled, the exchange is working to stabilize operations and restore trust. “We are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,” the exchange said. Full platform functionality is expected to return in the coming days, though Nobitex has warned that the timeline may be revised depending on the results of ongoing system checks.

      "description": "BNB Chain is set to launch its most aggressive speed upgrade yet. To increase transaction throughput, improve validator performance, and enhance responsiveness, the network will implement the Maxwell hardfork on the mainnet on June 30. This will reduce block times from 1.5 seconds to just 0.75 seconds. Three proposals, BEP-524, BEP-563, and BEP-564, are driving the upgrade. Each focuses on important aspects of network performance. BEP-524 cuts block intervals in half, allowing decentralized applications to have lower latency and faster transaction confirmations. BEP-563 enhances validator messages to reduce missed votes or sync delays under more stringent block cycles. Through the use of more sophisticated block-fetching logic to boost syncing efficiency, BEP-564 enhances node-to-node communication. All of these improvements demonstrate how BNB ( BNB ) Chain is constantly working to improve user experience and increase throughput, especially in high-demand areas like decentralized finance, GameFi, and NFT trading.

Maxwell goes beyond optimization by aiming to improve real-time user experience, accelerate dApp interactions, and preserve node operator and validator performance in the face of increasing network demand. “Maxwell is more than just a speed boost. It’s a foundational upgrade for a faster, more reliable BNB Chain,” developers wrote in a May 22 statement previewing the launch. The upgrade also modifies several consensus parameters. Epoch length has doubled from 500 to 1000, while each validator’s turn length increases to 16 blocks, still just 12 seconds under the new timing. Fast finality can now be reached in under 2 seconds. These changes are intended to maintain block stability and validator coordination despite the higher throughput. The maximum extractable value ecosystem is also affected. To stay competitive in the compressed timing environment, arbitrage searchers and MEV builders will need to modify their strategies as each block will be less than 1 second. At press time, BNB is trading at $654, up 1% on the day. Daily trading volume is up 28%, indicating rising spot market activity. According to Coinglass data , derivatives volume surged 57.5% to $318.5 million in the past 24 hours, reflecting heightened speculative activity as the upgrade is rolled out.

      "title": "Shiba Inu Investor Who Turned $8K into $10M Reveals what he’s  Buying in 2025",
      "description": "The post Shiba Inu Investor Who Turned $8K into $10M Reveals what he’s Buying in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Back in 2021, a little-known investor shocked the crypto world after turning an $8,000 bet on Shiba Inu (SHIB) into over $10 million—a life-changing win that etched SHIB into the history books of memecoin lore. But in 2025, that same crypto mogul has a new prediction. Their eyes aren’t on Dogecoin, FLOKI, or even PEPE. Instead, they have their eyes fixed on a new disruptor that has captured the attention of Telegram groups, influencers, and even the deepest alpha circles of Twitter: Little Pepe. And the buzz is justified. It combines innovation with an unprecedented level of community focus within the crypto ecosystem. Little Pepe: The Next Generation Layer 2 Blockchain Memes are now a great source of entertainment in modern social culture; people send and receive memes as they chat. On this basis, the Little Pepe meme token introduces itself as a new generation, layer-two blockchain, solely developed for memes. At its heart, Little Pepe integrates the meme culture and viral essence with brand-new technologies in the blockchain world, like: Ultra-low gas fees Warp-speed security Finality faster than Elon tweets Bot-proof trading architecture But this isn’t just another Ethereum scaler—it’s a full-blown meme multiverse with a mission to out-meme, out-speed, and out-build every chain in existence. Unlike traditional chains, Little Pepe’s infrastructure will support a dedicated memes launchpad, onboard top creators, and guarantee that sniper bots don’t stand a chance. And that’s just the beginning. Tokenomics of Little Pepe Here’s how the frog-themed token is hopping toward sustainability and moon potential: Allocation Percentage Purpose Liquidity 10% Deep, secure trading without rug pull fears Presale 26.5% For early believers riding the frog rocket Chain Reserves 30% Future-proofing the network and incentivizing long-term development DEX Allocation 10% Readiness for DEX launches and market-making activities Marketing 10% Massive campaigns, influencer blitzes, and maybe a Pepe billboard in NYC Staking & Rewards 13.5% Rewarding #HOLDERS4LIFE with juicy returns Tax 0% ZERO tax on buys/sells. True DeFi freedom With zero buy/sell tax, it’s built for smooth, frictionless trading—one of the cleanest plays in the DeFi arena. The Roadmap: From Cryptowomb to King The Little Pepe roadmap isn’t just quirky—it’s calculated for mass adoption, narrative hype, and organic growth: 1. Pregnancy Presale Launch Strategic Anonymous Partnerships Maximum Community Hype 2. Birth Top Exchange Listings (2 confirmed at launch) Explosive Marketing Targeting $1 Billion MCAP 3. Growth EVM-compatible Layer 2 Chain Aim to reach Top 100 on CMC The world’s first anti-sniper chain A Layer 2 for Memes – Built Different What makes Little Pepe revolutionary is its exclusive focus on meme chains. Unlike other Layer 2s trying to be everything for everyone, Little Pepe is laser-focused on meme culture, ensuring: Fastest transactions Lowest fees Dedicated launchpad for meme tokens Sniper bot resistance at the chain level This isn’t just another token. It’s a home for the next SHIBs, DOGEs, and PEPEs—a breeding ground for viral culture, powered by rock-solid tech. Backed by Anonymous Meme Experts The team behind Little Pepe includes several anonymous veterans of the meme coin world. These behind-the-scenes whales and devs have had their hands in multiple 100x+ projects, and they’ve now united behind one purpose: to make Little Pepe the next big success story in crypto. They’re not just building a token—they’re engineering a movement, equipped with tech, culture, and a roadmap that blends humor with precision. Explosive $LILPEPE Giveaway To mark the presale launch, Little Pepe is giving away $770,000 worth of tokens to 10 lucky winners—$77,000 each. This is more than a marketing tactic—it’s a community-first gesture that puts real value in the hands of the frog army. Participation is already going viral, with thousands entering across X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, and Discord. If you missed SHIB, you won’t want to miss this. Why This Could Be the SHIB of 2025 Let’s connect the dots: Criteria SHIB (2021) $LILPEPE (2025) Entry Price $0.00000001 $0.003 Meme Appeal High Even higher – modern, meta, Gen Z-ready Utility None originally Full Layer 2 chain with meme Launchpad Roadmap Vague Structured, clear, and hilarious Partnerships Unknown at start Anonymous meme legends involved Tax Varies 0% tax Security & Anti-bot None Built-in sniper bot resistance Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss the Leap History doesn’t always repeat, but it rhymes—and right now, Little Pepe is singing the same chorus that SHIB did before its moonshot. With a purpose-built Layer 2 chain, zero-tax tokenomics, sniper bot protection, and expert backers, Little Pepe isn’t just another coin—it’s the future home of meme culture in Web3. And with top CEX listings already lined up and aiming for the world’s biggest exchange, this is your chance to front-run the next generational wealth wave.

      "title": "Best Crypto Presales for 2025: Experts Select Top New Cryptocurrencies for High Potential Returns",
      "description": "As Bitcoin approaches $108,000 and altcoins regain strength on the back of ETF momentum, institutional flows, and regulatory optimism, presale tokens are emerging as key opportunities for investors seeking outsized gains. Analysts are pointing to a mix of politically charged meme tokens, high-speed Layer-2s, and payment solutions as the top crypto bets of the second half of 2025. Here are the six presales experts are watching closely: MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGAFINANCE) Positioned as the political meme coin of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing early interest with bold branding and rapid momentum. Analysts note that it has already become a focus for high-risk, high-reward traders looking for aggressive ROI setups before broader market exposure. With a campaign-driven narrative and increasing mentions in early presale rankings, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be emerging as the cycle’s standout meme contender. Early investors and market analysts are closely tracking its high-volume interest and accelerated wallet activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t aiming for utility—it’s engineered for attention, speculation, and potential fast-paced growth. In a market increasingly driven by narrative and emotion, this token appears designed to dominate headlines and trader sentiment as listings draw near. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is positioning itself as a Layer-1 Web3 aggregator. It has raised over $18 million and confirmed a top-tier exchange listing. Its roadmap includes tools like a multi-chain wallet and tokenization marketplace, though some concerns remain around delivery timelines. Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy is a Layer-2 solution for Solana with deflationary tokenomics and a $58 million presale. It launched in late June 2025 with cross-chain capabilities and high staking APYs, but transparency issues and future execution are under watch. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Bitcoin Hyper brings Solana-like speed to a Bitcoin-secured network, using SVM for scaling. With audit clearance and a Q3 2025 launch, HYPER is drawing some attention—but still early-stage. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) BTC Bull ties its meme token value to Bitcoin price milestones, triggering burns and rewards. Backed by community hype and a bullish BTC trend, it’s speculative but may benefit from macro momentum. Remittix (RTX) Remittix offers crypto-to-fiat remittance infrastructure with flat fees and multi-currency support. It’s raised over $15 million and targets financial utility, though competition in PayFi remains high. Final Words While multiple presales are gaining attention in 2025, none are commanding momentum quite like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Built for speed, speculation, and cultural virality, it’s leading the charge as the token most likely to deliver outsized returns this cycle. Traders hunting for the next 50x or 100x return are increasingly viewing MAGACOIN FINANCE as more than a meme—it’s becoming a cultural signal in 2025’s crypto cycle. With listing anticipation building and retail FOMO increasing, experts suggest this could be the year MAGACOIN FINANCE dominates presale performance charts. As other projects navigate roadmaps and utility narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already turning heads with raw buyer interest and breakout potential. For traders seeking pure upside in a hype-driven market, this is the name to watch.

      "description": "Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, has begun restoring user access to wallets after suffering a major cyberattack that drained over $90m in assets earlier this month. In a statement issued Sunday, the Tehran-based platform said that wallet access was being reactivated in phases, beginning with verified users and spot wallets. Other wallet types will follow, contingent on the completion of identity checks. Nobitex urged users to complete verification promptly and noted that wallet balances would become visible once all security and data accuracy checks were finalized. “We are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,” the company said. It warned that the timeline may shift depending on technical conditions and additional security requirements. Follow- up on Nobitex Security Incident, Step-by-step wallet access has begun, 29 June 2025 Please note: 1. This process is being carried out gradually, starting with verified users and initially for spot wallets, followed by other types of wallets. 2. The identity… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 29, 2025 Users Risk Losing Funds if Deposits Are Sent to Outdated Wallets, Nobitex Says The company also advised users not to deposit funds to previously issued wallet addresses, which are now invalid due to a full system migration. Any transfers to the old addresses could result in permanent fund loss. Users relying on automated systems such as mining rigs or saved withdrawal configurations were told to update their details or wait for new personal addresses to be issued. The platform’s gradual reboot follows a highly disruptive breach earlier this month. The cyberattack prompted Iran’s central bank to intervene. Authorities React to Hack With Curbs on Operating Hours for Domestic Exchanges Authorities have since ordered all domestic crypto exchanges to limit operations between 10am and 8pm. This measure aims to strengthen security and reduce the risk of after-hours attacks. Meanwhile, the pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow, also known as Gonjeshke Darande, claimed responsibility for the breach. The incident marks yet another escalation in cyberwarfare involving state-linked actors in the region. Nobitex handles the bulk of Iran’s crypto trades. It plays a key role in the country’s expanding digital asset ecosystem. However, the recent breach has shaken user confidence. It has also raised concerns about the strength of Iran’s broader financial infrastructure, especially as cyber threats grow more sophisticated.

      "description": "The post XRP vs SEC: Is July 3 the Date the Lawsuit Officially Ends? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is finally nearing an end. In a recent update, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company is officially dropping its cross-appeal against the SEC. In a post on social media, Garlinghouse shared, “We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important — building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” He also said that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal too, just as it had previously indicated. Now, speculations are rising about whether the SEC might formally drop its appeal during a closed-door meeting scheduled for July 3, 2025. Why July 3 Matters According to the SEC’s official notice, a private meeting will be held on July 3 at 2:00 p.m. ET. The meeting is closed to the public and will cover various topics, including settlements, administrative proceedings, and litigation matters, which many in the crypto community believe could involve the Ripple case. The meeting details were published under the Sunshine Act Notice, which lists the agenda as including the “resolution of litigation claims.” This has fueled rumors that the SEC might use this opportunity to officially vote on withdrawing its appeal. What Legal Experts Say Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel weighed in on the situation, clarifying that “there’s nothing further for Judge Torres to do. She already issued her final judgment a year ago, so once both parties have dismissed their appeals (which the SEC still needs to vote on), it will go into effect.” Fagel explained that the only step left is for the SEC to hold a vote to drop its appeal, something that could very well happen during the July 3 meeting. What’s Next for Ripple and XRP? If the SEC drops its appeal, it would mark the official end of one of crypto’s longest and most closely watched legal battles. Ripple would finally be free to move ahead without the legal cloud hanging over it, and the XRP community is already beaming with excitement about what this could mean for the token’s future.",

      "description": "XRP price started a steady increase above the $2.120 zone. The price is consolidating and might aim for a move above the $2.220 resistance. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.20 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.190 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2.220 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Surge XRP price formed a base above the $2.080 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.120 and $2.150 resistance levels. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.190 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $2.20 level. A high was formed at $2.2191 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2.20 level, but it is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.070 swing low to the $2.2191 high. The price is now trading above $2.180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.220 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. The next resistance is $2.320. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Downside Correction? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.180 level. The next major support is near the $2.1450 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.070 swing low to the $2.2191 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.1450 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.220 and $2.250. Major Resistance Levels – $2.1450 and $2.120.",

This has raised concerns across the crypto market. He has sold over $3 million worth of MSTR stock in recent months. Insiders Offload $13.6M With No Buying On June 18, Phong Le disposed of 8,400 shares of Class A stock, though he still holds over 16,000 shares, plus 10,500 in preferred shares across two series. Microstrategy insiders have sold a combined $13.6 million worth of stock, with no buying. Other key executives have also been offloading shares. Hey @saylor …. why did your director dump 70% of his $MSTR stock last week??? https://t.co/8bRUsUEGrB pic.twitter.com/iOgyOSw0Yy — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) June 11, 2025 Last week, MicroStrategy Director Rickertsen also sold nearly 70% of his $MSTR shares. He sold 26,390 shares for over $9.8 million, while Patten offloaded 9,550 shares for $3.5 million. Why Hold MSTR If Bitcoin Is the Superior Asset? Experts are asking if Bitcoin is the ‘superior asset,’ as Saylor claims, then why buy MicroStrategy stock at all. Investors might eventually realize this and choose to buy Bitcoin directly, while insiders quietly use MSTR as a way to cash out. If Bitcoin is the superior asset according to Michael Saylor,then how long before everyone buying Microstrategy stock realizes they`re being used for exit liquidity and they dump $MSTR for Bitcoin themselves? House of cards in the making. FYI: Michael Saylor was the biggest… https://t.co/uUwIZLFlLA — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) June 29, 2025 Given the company’s deep ties to Bitcoin, this insider dump is prompting questions about the company’s internal confidence and future outlook. However, some long-term holders argue that it is just routine transfers and not a sign of lost confidence. However, MSTR is up 27% year-to-date, beating the broader market, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stash is now nearing 600,000 BTC. Saylor Hints at Another Bitcoin Buy Recently, Saylor shared the company’s BTC tracker on X, showing that they are just 7,655 short of 600K. His posts usually come right before a new purchase. Last week, it added $26M worth of BTC, and another buy could mark its record 12-week streak. With over $21B in unrealized profit, Strategy shows no signs of slowing its Bitcoin accumulation.",

      "description": "In the current crypto market, even big names like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and XRP are under pressure. Prices are shaky, and many investors are being cautious. But while the well-known coins are slowing down, a new project called MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to get a lot of attention. Thanks to strong buying activity, generous staking rewards, and growing support from crypto analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about investment opportunities of 2025. Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP: Popular, But Facing Challenges Ethereum (ETH): Price Worries Despite Institutional Support Ethereum is still the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value (over $296 billion), trading at around $2,453. Even though there’s been some good news, like ETF approvals and interest from big investors, Ethereum’s price has dropped 3.1% over the past week and lost over 7% in the last 30 days. Some technical patterns are making traders nervous, and a recent network upgrade (Shapella) released about $30 billion worth of ETH, which could increase selling in the short term. Cardano (ADA): Investors are Buying, But Controversy Lingers Cardano is trading at around $0.56 after falling 6% this week, though it’s still up more than 55% for the year. Large investors (also known as “whales”) are buying up ADA, and there are rumors of a partnership with Litecoin that could help its future. However, the project has taken a hit due to allegations involving its founder, Charles Hoskinson, and how funds from its early days were handled. That has made some investors hesitant in the short term. XRP: Legal Issues Keep Buyers Cautious XRP is trading at around $2.19, but its price continues to swing up and down due to its ongoing legal case with the U.S. SEC. Ripple (the company behind XRP) recently filed a new motion for a settlement, but legal experts aren’t confident that the matter will be resolved anytime soon. Meanwhile, XRPL’s tech upgrades are solid, but the token remains suppressed below its May highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale of 2025 While other major cryptos fight to maintain footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the spotlight as one of the most talked-about presales of the year, drawing in both retail and institutional interest at an accelerating pace. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is advancing rapidly. The previous rounds sold out quickly—seeing a flood of demand as investors chase the kind of early-stage upside rarely seen in the current market. Some estimates place potential returns at 30x or more for early backers if launch price targets are hit. With a capped total supply (reported at 170 billion tokens) and decentralized, inflation-resistant tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is engineered to drive long-term value. The project’s smart contract has been fully audited by HashEx, giving investors added security and confidence. Presale participants are offered high APY staking incentives and analysts are turning increasingly bullish on MAGACOIN FINANCE, pointing to strong fundamentals, supply scarcity, and explosive presale traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being featured on leading crypto platforms and is frequently highlighted in Q3 2025’s top crypto picks. Final words: Why You Should Pay Attention Now With Ethereum flashing bearish signs, Cardano under scrutiny, and XRP locked in a legal gray zone, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few projects showing true breakout potential to outperform them all in 2025. If you’re looking for high-growth potential before exchange listings, now may be your best shot.

      "title": "Iran may have moved over 400 kg of enriched uranium before US and Israeli airstrikes",
      "description": "Iran is sitting on over 400 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60%, and no one knows if it was destroyed, moved, or buried under rubble. After the United States and Israel bombed three of Iran’s major nuclear sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — there’s growing concern that Tehran may have used the chaos to hide its most dangerous nuclear material. That fear isn’t just about war though, folks. It’s about inflation, too. Nuclear uncertainty hits markets hard, and when oil traders and policymakers don’t know what’s coming, prices go up. Supply chains panic. Governments hoard. The bombs may have landed in Iran, but the economic pressure is global. According to Reuters , US President Donald Trump confirmed that the strikes involved bunker-busting bombs, claiming the sites were “obliterated.” But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is in charge of monitoring Iran’s nuclear program, said the real damage is still unknown — especially at Fordow, the underground facility responsible for producing most of Iran’s high-level enriched uranium. Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said on Monday that the centrifuges were likely badly damaged, but there’s no clear evidence yet that the actual stockpile — nearly 9 tonnes in total, including the 400+ kg enriched close to weapons-grade — was hit. Tehran may have moved uranium before the first bombs dropped Grossi also said Iran had notified him on June 13, just hours before Israel launched its first attacks, that it was “taking measures to protect its nuclear equipment and materials.” He didn’t give details, but officials think that means the uranium was quietly relocated. One diplomat familiar with the situation said much of the enriched uranium from Fordow appeared to have been moved “days in advance,” almost like Tehran was warned. A satellite image showing trucks lined up near the facility before the strike backs up that claim. Trump dismissed that completely. In an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, he insisted: “They didn’t move anything. It’s very dangerous to do. It is very heavy — very, very heavy. It’s a very hard thing to do.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also said he hadn’t seen any intelligence proving Iran relocated its uranium. The search for the material is now a long process. Olli Heinonen, who served as the IAEA’s top inspector between 2005 and 2010, told Reuters that verifying the stockpile’s status could take months. “There could be materials which are inaccessible, distributed under the rubble or lost during the bombing,” he said. It’ll involve forensics, environmental samples, and complex recovery operations. Iran says it’s done nothing wrong. But earlier this month, the IAEA’s 35-member Board of Governors passed a resolution accusing Iran of violating its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Tehran responded by voting in parliament to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. It also accused the watchdog of helping justify the airstrikes by providing diplomatic cover. The IAEA denies that claim. Grossi admitted his team can’t confirm if Iran’s nuclear work is entirely peaceful. But he said there’s also no solid evidence of a coordinated weapons program. Still, without knowing what happened to that 400 kg of enriched uranium, governments are forced to make their own risk calls. Heinonen said transparency from the agency will be key. “Member states can then make their own risk assessments,” he said. Still though, no matter which side is right, it wouldn’t end well for the world’s economy. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025. Learn More",

      "description": "The post XRP Price Prediction For June 30 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price action has been volatile over the past week, and right now, it’s testing a resistance level around the $2.19 to $2.20 mark. This level has proven difficult for XRP to break in recent days, with the token getting rejected each time it approaches this zone. A confirmed move above $2.20, with prices holding steadily, could open the door for a rally toward the next target around $2.25. The next resistance area sits between $2.30 and $2.35. Support Zones to Watch On the downside, XRP has strong support levels between $2.10 and $2.07. If prices drop, these levels are expected to attract buying interest and potentially stabilize the market. As of now, XRP seems to be trading sideways within this range, showing no clear breakout in either direction. A Market Moving with Bitcoin XRP’s next big move could depend heavily on what Bitcoin does next. If Bitcoin struggles to break through its own resistance levels, altcoins like XRP could follow a similar path, staying range-bound for a little longer. On the other hand, if Bitcoin makes a strong breakout, it might give XRP the momentum it needs to move higher. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Looking at the bigger picture, XRP has been holding firm within a wider price channel for several months. While the short-term trend appears neutral, the long-term setup remains bullish as long as prices stay above key support levels. On the bullish side, XRP now has over 7.1 million wallets.. The price may be taking a short break, but another big move could be coming soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19. A successful push above $2.20 could be the first step in a fresh rally.",

      "title": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) Likely Price If It Hits XRP All-Time High Market Cap",
      "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) has continued to follow similar market trends as some major cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Over the past week, both assets have shown comparable price movements, reacting to broader market conditions and geopolitical events. However, a key question for SHIB investors is: what would the token’s price look like if it achieved the same market capitalization as XRP at its all-time high? To assess this, we compare the historical peak market cap of XRP with SHIB’s current valuation and circulating supply. This theoretical analysis helps illustrate the kind of price growth required for SHIB to reach a new high, though it is not intended as financial advice. Recent Price Movement Comparison Both XRP and SHIB experienced a price decline on June 22, following the intensification of the Iran-Israel conflict. XRP fell below $2 to approximately $1.90 but has since recovered significantly. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19 , reflecting a 15.2% increase from its June 22 low. Similarly, Shiba Inu dropped to $0.00001010 on the same date. Since then, the token has rebounded and is currently priced at approximately $0.00001153 , representing a 12.87% rise. XRP’s Historical Market Cap High Although XRP reached a price peak of $3.84 in January 2018, its market capitalization at that time was around $128 billion. However, a new all-time high for market cap was achieved in January 2025, when XRP reached a market valuation of $190 billion. This was despite the price being slightly lower, at approximately $3.34, due to an increase in the circulating supply resulting from ongoing token releases by Ripple through its escrow program. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Calculating SHIB’s Potential Price at XRP’s ATH Market Cap As of its current price of $0.00001140, SHIB holds a market capitalization of roughly $6.71 billion. Assuming the circulating supply remains fixed at 589.25 trillion tokens, reaching XRP’s peak market cap of $190 billion would require a substantial increase. To match this valuation, SHIB’s market cap would need to grow by approximately 2,731%. At this level, the price per SHIB token would be around $0.0003224, representing a significant rise and establishing a new record high for the asset. Forecasts from Analysts and Models This price level is not entirely speculative. Several analysts and AI-based forecasting models have already projected similar targets for SHIB in the medium to long term. For instance, Himanshu Maradiya, affiliated with the CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem, told Forbes that SHIB could trade between $0.0001 and $0.0003 by the end of the year, contingent on favourable market developments. Meanwhile, a panel of blockchain analysts featured by Finder expects SHIB to gradually appreciate, forecasting it may not reach the $0.0003 mark until between 2030 and 2035. Beyond that, they anticipate the token could eventually hit $0.0008543. In contrast, artificial intelligence models like Gemini and ChatGPT suggest a slightly earlier timeline. According to their projections, SHIB could trade around $0.0003 sometime between 2025 and 2026. This analysis illustrates the price that Shiba Inu could theoretically reach if it attains the same market capitalization that XRP attained at its highest point. While $0.0003224 may seem ambitious, it is grounded in a logical extrapolation of market cap data and supply dynamics. Nonetheless, such projections rely on a range of factors, including market adoption, utility development, and overall investor sentiment.

      "title": "IRS Intensifies Scrutiny Of Crypto With Surge In Warning Letters",
      "description": "As crypto prices see a new rebound with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the pack, US investors are not only anticipating significant returns on BTC and other digital assets but also facing increased scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Recent reports indicate that the Internal Revenue Service has dispatched a wave of warning letters to crypto investors, raising alarms about the accuracy of the information they provided on their tax returns. Crypto Tax Inquiries Skyrocket In the past two months, the number of these warning letters has spiked, signaling a renewed focus on digital asset reporting. Crypto tax experts have noted that this uptick is markedly higher than in previous years. David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, reported a dramatic increase in support inquiries related to IRS communications . From May to June, conversations on CoinLedger about “IRS letters” surged to nearly 800, a ninefold increase compared to the same timeframe in 2024. Kemmerer explained, “Thousands of investors are getting these letters. Naturally, when that happens, we see a flood of customers coming to us asking, ‘What do I do?’” This sentiment is echoed by two crypto tax attorneys, Jordan Bass and Andrew Gordon, who have also observed a noticeable rise in inquiries regarding these IRS notifications. Bass mentioned that his firm received inquiries from at least ten recipients of the letters in the last two months, a significant increase from the previous year when no inquiries were reported. IRS Warning Letters The IRS has a history of intensifying its efforts to ensure compliance among cryptocurrency investors. Following the agency’s acquisition of thousands of customer records from Coinbase in 2017, it implemented a series of “voluntary compliance” letters aimed at encouraging accurate reporting among investors. The latest notices inform recipients that the Internal Revenue Service possesses information indicating they hold “one or more accounts containing virtual currency.” While some letters advise recipients to review their reporting for accuracy, others require a response, either through amended returns or explanations justifying their reported transactions. Interestingly, Gordon noted a potential commonality among recent recipients of the letters, many of whom had accounts on the Seychelles-based crypto exchange Poloniex , raising questions about the data the IRS may have accessed to trigger these communications. Kemmerer speculated that the increased outreach from the IRS typically follows the agency acquiring new data, suggesting that the notices might be part of broader enforcement efforts. “I’m sure there are just people randomly getting selected, and the lucky ones get these scary letters,” he said.

      "title": "Bitcoin Price Surges Above $108,000: Analyst Predicts Potential Breakout To $150,000",
      "description": "The Bitcoin price has recently climbed back above the $108,000 mark, yet it struggles to surpass its current record of $111,800, creating a sense of uncertainty in the market. This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency’s performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, “We’re standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000–$150,000 zone over the next few months.” This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, “$93K is not bearish. It’s clearly a gift!.” Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

      "title": "Solana, XRP, and Avalanche Price Levels Highlighted: Analysts Favor New Crypto with Greater Upside",
      "description": "Crypto investors are eyeing multiple high-profile altcoins this year. Solana (SOL), XRP, and Avalanche (AVAX) have all shown signs of strength, but analysts suggest their near-term upside may be limited. Technical resistance, legal overhangs, and slow-moving institutional adoption are slowing momentum across the board. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building massive traction as a new force in the market. Its capped supply, politically charged branding, and aggressive tokenomics are positioning it as a high-upside entry point heading into the next wave of altcoin rallies. Let’s break down where each coin stands—and why many investors are shifting attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. 1. Solana Price Outlook: ETF Hopes, But No Green Light Yet Solana has still been favored by retail traders and developers. Speculation and anticipation of a Solana ETF increased. But no Solana ETFs were filed or approved by the end of June 2025. Which has kept the SOL price between a range. SOL’s rise has been dramatic, but it’s partly driven by meme-coin action — which raises questions of sustainability. It is ok not to agree with some Solana price predictions for Q3 2025, most of which ranges $150 – $175. If momentum picks up, a rally to $180 or $183 is possible. The downside risk is real. Without a confirmed ETF or clearer institutional backing, Solana could slide back toward the $125–$135 range. SOL price chart XRP Price Prediction: ETF Buzz Meets Regulatory Uncertainty XRP’s chart is already showing initial signs of a potential breakout, as was the case with Bitcoin before its recent surge. Regulatory certainty is backing sentiment, and Ripple’s continued expansion around the world is still propelling long-term optimism. Forecasts for XRP in Q3 2025 are $2.20-$3.50. If Ripple ETF is approved and institutional adoption becomes more robust, XRP price could hit $5.81 or even $8. Court delays and sector-wide withdrawals might, however, see XRP back into the $1.78–$2.10 support zone. Speculators trading the price of XRP are optimistic but wary. A breakout over $3.40 would validate a breakout, but the direction to go will largely depend on regulatory news. XRP price chart Avalanche Price: Signs of Growth, But Resistance Ahead Avalanche continues to attract attention for its real-world use cases. From New Jersey digitizing real estate on-chain to the launch of the Fan3 engagement platform, AVAX is proving its utility. However, the AVAX price remains volatile. Technically, AVAX is forming higher lows but struggling to break past key resistance around $18.50. If it clears this mark with strong volume, a short-term push toward $30–$32 is possible. The $36–$44 range will be tough to crack without major momentum. Forecasts for Avalanche price in 2025 average around $40. In a highly bullish market, some analysts suggest it could reach $65, though that remains a stretch unless sentiment improves broadly. AVAX price chart Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Getting Analyst Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is going to be this year’s hidden gem! While existing altcoins languish in technical quibbles and regulatory lags, MAGACOIN is booming with organic demand and vigorous fundamentals. With a project capped at 170 billion, there are no secrets or hidden inflation. That fixed supply model is fueling early accumulation as demand grows among investors. Earlier phases were quickly sold out, and new buyers are flocking before listing on the big exchanges. Security is another major factor. MAGACOIN FINANCE is audited by HashEx, which has helped draw both retail buyers and large crypto funds. Lack of VC control also makes confidence in the project’s inherent worth that much stronger. Some analysts predict potential returns of 20x, particularly for those who get in early. Its branding — bold, political and polarizing — is resonating with a significant portion of crypto investors in search of a sense of vibrancy and identity. The Smarter Move for ROI While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche all have long-term potential, they are moving at a slower pace. Each faces headwinds—whether from legal delays, ETF speculation, or resistance zones. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a faster, more explosive opportunity. Analysts tracking early market behavior say the token’s design, capped supply, and community-driven rise could make it one of the biggest gainers of the year. For investors focused on maximum upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the clear favorite in 2025.

Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,450 level. The price is trading above $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains stable above the $2,420 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,420 support level, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,450 and $2,480 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2,500 zone. However, the bulls were active above the $2,500 level. A high was formed at $2,523 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,394 swing low to the $2,523 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,520 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,580 level. A clear move above the $2,580 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,480 level. The first major support sits near the $2,460 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,394 swing low to the $2,523 high. A clear move below the $2,460 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,400 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

      "title": "South Korea Puts Brakes on CBDC Plans — Here’s What to Know",
      "description": "South Korea has put the brakes on its digital currency testing project, pausing preparations for the next phase just as stablecoins take on renewed political and market significance. The Bank of Korea reportedly informed participating banks that it will temporarily halt discussions related to the second stage of its central bank digital currency pilot, which was originally slated to begin later this year. A BOK official confirmed the decision to Bloomberg , citing the need for reassessment amid shifting priorities. New President’s Stablecoin Push Prompts Central Bank Caution The delay comes as newly elected President Lee Jae-myung places growing emphasis on stablecoins. Just weeks into office, Lee has proposed expanding the field of issuers by allowing companies with as little as 500m won, or about $370,000, in equity to issue won-based stablecoins. South Korea’s central bank halted its digital currency testing project, telling participating banks it will temporarily pause discussions related to the initiative https://t.co/TuBn6SLXvo — Bloomberg (@business) June 30, 2025 His administration has signaled that stablecoins could play a major role in the country’s digital asset roadmap. BOK officials appear cautious about moving too quickly.

Crypto Holdings Now Key Part of Personal Wealth for Millions in South Korea Meanwhile, South Korea remains one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Over a third of the population, roughly 18m people, are involved in digital asset trading. On particularly busy days, local crypto exchange volumes have surpassed those of traditional equity markets such as the Kospi and Kosdaq. A recent industry survey found that more than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have experience trading crypto . Moreover, one in four currently hold digital coins. For those invested, crypto now makes up at least 14% of their total financial portfolios. In addition, many maintain wallets across several domestic exchanges. Enthusiasm around digital assets has also spilled into the stock market. Shares of companies linked to the Bank of Korea’s CBDC initiative have rallied in recent weeks . Kakao Pay has more than doubled in value this month, while LG CNS surged nearly 70% before easing slightly.

      "description": "The crypto market is surging with optimism following the historic launch of the first spot XRP ETF in Canada and rapidly increasing approval odds in the United States. Yet, even amid this institutional breakthrough, one emerging project is generating powerful early momentum among traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP’s ETF milestone represents a step forward for mainstream adoption, many are pivoting toward early-phase assets that offer greater upside. XRP ETF News Marks Institutional Milestone Ripple has come a long way to gain credibility among institutions. Purpose Investments has launched the world’s first spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP in CAD as well as USD. Canada is already recognized as a world leader in regulated access to cryptos for institutions. This development cements Canada’s position as a leader in this field and sets an important precedent for others. Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to a US recession. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot XRP ETF when there is enough regulatory clarity and Ripple’s legal case is settled. According to the odds on Polymarket, the majority of predictions indicate that it could be approved by the end of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention With Strategic Timing While XRP’s institutional story dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a breakout force in the early-stage investment space. Its presale phases have seen instant sellouts, and analyst coverage is intensifying around what many now see as one of the most structurally aligned new tokens of the year. The project’s appeal lies in its architectural scarcity, security verifications, and early-mover advantage. These features have made it a target for capital rotation among investors looking beyond legacy plays. With the broader market seeking asymmetric returns ahead of the next major bull cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized not for its comparisons — but for its independent setup and compelling risk-reward ratio. Market Dynamics Favor Early Entries Institutional attention is building around regulatory milestones, but seasoned investors understand that much of the explosive growth in crypto emerges from earlier phases — before large capital fully enters the space. While XRP is set to benefit from ETF listings and long-term adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as an opportunity for meaningful portfolio transformation during the pre-mainstream window. Pro traders and early adopters are already reallocating capital into strategic assets with credible foundations and timing advantages — and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top that list. Final Thoughts Ripple’s ETF progress is a defining moment for the asset class, offering XRP a new gateway into institutional portfolios. Yet, even as major tokens gain regulatory validation, a new frontier is forming — one where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are setting the tone for early-stage, high-conviction investment strategies. The window for entry may not remain open for long.

      "description": "While Ethereum has remained in developer mode, focusing on platform upgrades and scaling efforts, Lightchain AI has been attracting traders in the crypto market. With all 15 presale stages already completed and the Bonus Round ongoing, the project is drawing the attention of investors due to its AI-driven architecture and price increase. Lightchain AI presents a virtual machine to carry out AI tasks and a model that rewards users according to their computational value–features that builders and investors prefer. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is showing that traders are noticing the project due to its real-world usage and hype. Ethereum Focuses on Core Development and Long-Term Upgrades Ethereum has been focusing on platform development and long-term upgrades that are expected to make the network scalable, efficient, and user-friendly. The newly launched Pectra upgrade, which was launched on May 7, 2025, fixed several issues and added new features like the staking limit increase and wallet usage. In addition, Ethereum Next’s roadmap will focus on the Fulu-Osaka upgrade, which is expected to launch by the end of 2025 or early 2026, developing Verkle trees to reduce storage requirements and increase network efficiency. With developments like the single-shot finality which is expected to reduce transaction confirmation times, Ethereum’s place in the blockchain world is secured. Lightchain AI Captures Immediate Interest From Active Traders Lightchain AI has been gaining attention from investors due to its structure, which focuses on real-world usage, and its presale. With Stage 15 already completed, the Bonus Round offers fixed token pricing and increased value, especially after the removal of the 5% Team Allocation. Those tokens will now be used to support the development of the protocol, developer grants, and builder rewards–showing a move that puts the platform first. Lightchain AI’s tokenomics is expected to build investor confidence, with 40% of the supply allocated to presale, 28.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity, 6.5 to treasury, and 5% to marketing and partnerships. The platform’s improved gas system allows users to pay for transactions based on how complex the AI tasks they are carrying out are, ensuring usage without issues. For traders looking for functionality over speculation, Lightchain AI offers a better structure. Traders Act Fast—And All Eyes Are on Lightchain AI Traders in the crypto market always go for any investment opportunity they discover, and right now, they are moving towards Lightchain AI. With its Bonus Round price fixed at $0.007 and with over $20.9 million raised, the project is attracting attention. What makes it special? Decentralized validator nodes, AI-powered infrastructure, and a developer Grant pool that is pushing development on the platform. With the mainnet launch and public code release expected to happen in the coming weeks, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next move for traders looking for opportunities in the crypto industry.

      "title": "Game Designer Analyzes XRP Path to 913,000% Price Rally",
      "description": "A renewed debate is emerging in the XRP community around a long-standing and highly ambitious theory that the token could one day be valued at $20,000. The idea, first introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP proponent Chad Steingraber, is gaining renewed attention as market conditions evolve and institutional interest in blockchain utility increases. Although XRP is currently trading around $2 , Steingraber maintains that a combination of institutional adoption, strategic asset utility, and supply restrictions could drive the asset’s value to unprecedented levels. It consists of three components: 1 – Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the “utility”) 2 – XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 – XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Foundation of the $20,000 Projection Chad Steingraber’s $20,000 price prediction is based on three main assumptions. He outlines a path where XRP transforms from a speculative asset into a core infrastructure component for global finance. According to him, this transformation hinges on three primary developments: Tokenized Asset Issuance on the XRP Ledger: Steingraber believes the adoption of the XRP Ledger by governments and institutions for issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will generate new demand for XRP. As the native token of the ledger, XRP would facilitate settlements involving these tokenized assets, thus increasing its utility. Use as a Reserve Asset: In this scenario, XRP would no longer function primarily as a tradable token. Instead, it would be held by financial institutions as a reserve asset , akin to how central banks hold gold. These reserves would support internal liquidity, enable seamless value transfer, and serve as backing for institution-specific digital assets. Absorption of Public Supply by Institutions: Steingraber suggests that over time, financial institutions will accumulate large amounts of XRP and remove them from public markets by locking them into private ledgers. This would reduce the circulating supply available for retail investors and could cause a significant price increase due to heightened scarcity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of Public Markets and the Transition to Private Use Steingraber views the current retail-driven XRP market as temporary. He argues that major institutions are unlikely to rely on public trading platforms due to transparency and regulatory concerns. Instead, enterprise participants would shift to private networks and rely on specialized liquidity providers to settle large-scale transactions securely. This shift implies that public trading of XRP is a transitional phase, with a more utility-focused institutional use case on the horizon. Anticipated Supply Shock and Institutional Demand Surge Another critical element in Steingraber’s forecast is a potential supply crisis triggered by rapid institutional acquisition. He claims that only around 20 billion XRP tokens remain in circulation after accounting for lost, burned, or locked coins. He warns that once institutions begin acquiring XRP aggressively, the available supply could fall to under 100 million tokens. Such a sharp reduction in supply, if met with sudden institutional demand, could lead to rapid price acceleration. However, he asserts that this demand would be driven by utility and operational necessity, not speculation. Global Competition for XRP Steingraber broadens the outlook by suggesting that competition for XRP will not be limited to U.S.-based institutions. He anticipates demand from international banks, sovereign wealth funds, and private entities seeking to integrate XRP into their digital infrastructure. He envisions XRP becoming an essential component of the global financial system. While the theory presents a compelling vision for XRP’s future utility, it remains highly controversial. It does not fully address the competitive landscape, where other digital assets also offer institutional-grade utility. Furthermore, the proposed valuation depends on widespread adoption that has yet to materialize at scale. Nevertheless, the discussion continues to attract interest, especially among XRP supporters who see long-term potential in its unique ledger technology and use cases.

      "title": "Top Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy Before 2025: Analysts Reveal Hidden Gems and High-ROI Crypto Presales",
      "description": "As Q4 2025 approaches, investors are zeroing in on the next generation of high-potential cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin consolidating and major altcoins facing mixed momentum, presales with strong fundamentals are taking center stage. Among the most talked-about candidates are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum—three projects gaining traction for their unique structures and explosive early momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Meets Market Narrative MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most dominant forces in the 2025 crypto cycle. Its presale has already raised significant amounts, with each stage selling out rapidly and early buyers seeing significant paper gains. The project operates with a fixed supply model and has passed a full audit by HashEx, signaling credibility in a market often lacking transparency. Backed by asymmetric upside potential and a politically infused narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been labeled by analysts as a defining early-entry opportunity of the year. Its structure resists inflation, and with no venture capital unlocks in sight, institutional and retail investors alike are watching closely. Analysts have noted its consistent traction in presale rankings and speculative forecasts continue to rise. Qubetics (TICS): Aiming to Bridge Web3 Fragmentation With over $18M raised during the presale which has sold hundreds of millions of tokens, Qubetics is entering the final phase of the presale. Qubetics is a cross-chain Web3 aggregator that aims to fix blockchain fragmentation, one of the ecosystem’s biggest issues. It’s distinctive value proposition evolves from its QubeQode IDE, an integrated development environment aimed at using decentralized applications across chains. Qubetics reduced the supply of the total tokens by more than 60%. This will make the tokens more scarce. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi Utility With Scaling Ambitions Mutuum Finance has garnered attention as one of the few presale projects that deliver on both innovation and investor confidence. The platform combines decentralized lending, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a Layer 2 scaling model — all within a transparent, CertiK-audited ecosystem. Investor incentives and smart tokenomics have propelled the project to raise significant capital in a short time. Analysts are watching closely as each presale phase narrows the gap between entry and launch valuation. With forecasts projecting multi-fold returns, Mutuum Finance is becoming a serious contender for investors targeting the DeFi resurgence in 2025. Final Thoughts: Presale Season Heating Up As Q4 2025 draws closer, a presale-driven momentum is becoming theme in crypto investing. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum offer a scarcity-based political narrative, infrastructure-grade tooling, and innovative DeFi design, respectively. Investor demand for these three projects keeps growing, and earlier stages sold out quickly. So, analysts are encouraging early positioning. If you’re trying to time your next entry into the bull phase of the market, then these presales could provide the upper hand before the listings reprice.

      "title": "Projected XRP Price If It Reclaims Half of Its Peak Market Dominance",
      "description": "As the total cryptocurrency market capitalization exceeds $3.28 trillion, discussions have resurfaced around XRP’s underperformance relative to other major assets. Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP’s Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market’s pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP’s growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP’s market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin’s has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP’s full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP’s current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market’s growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP’s long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

      "title": "FCA unveils new changes to the UK’s financial advice market",
      "description": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) unveiled plans to allow companies to offer consumers generic recommendations without complying with all the expensive rules around providing personalised advice. This is one of the biggest shake-ups of investment advice for a decade. Millions of British savers will be granted access to “targeted support” under wide-ranging new rules to aid people’s quest for better returns on their money. Barclays’ analysis shows that around 13 million adults in the UK are keeping about £430 billion in cash, based on the savers who currently have more than six months’ income in savings, which could be invested. Meanwhile, companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Vanguard have already started offering these services. FCA unveils new changes to the UK’s financial advice market The FCA described “a once-in-a-generation change” to the UK’s financial advice market. This change will allow companies to suggest to a group of people sitting on so much cash to consider investing some in shares to earn better returns over time. The move comes more than a decade after the FCA’s Retail Distribution Review, which was intended to increase the quality of financial advice but has also made it more expensive for the population. This left many people unable to afford such services, resulting in an “advice gap”. The FCA said the new regime is a remedy created to help more than half of British savers , who said in a recent survey that they needed further assistance investing their money. Based on the regulator’s argument, 7million British adults have more than £10,000 in cash savings and no investments. Hence, people between 13.5 million and 30.6million might gain from this focused assistance. The regulator also said it would consult on developing rules for this new activity of targeted support by December, enabling companies to make generic offers to groups of consumers with similar characteristics. This would no longer be caught by the burdensome requirements to give customers a “personal recommendation,” such as undertaking a fully detailed suitability assessment. Apart from these new changes, the FCA also plans to introduce a second, more focused, category called “simplified advice.” In this category, firms will be able to make a suggestion on a financial product to a customer, subject to a short document detailing their “essential relevant facts” – without having to conduct the full suitability assessment. Several prominent figures acknowledged the importance of the FCA’s proposal Several prominent figures have commented on FCA’s proposals. Dan Olley, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK’s largest “DIY” investment site, said the proposals will be genuinely transformational in cementing a healthy retail investment culture in the UK. According to Olley, it was obvious that there are important moments in life when several people find themselves in the advice gap. He further elaborated that in this situation, one cannot afford financial advice but needs more help than the rules permit. James Daley, a leader of the consumer group Fairer Finance, said the changes were moving in the right direction. However, he insists that these proposals must be put in place with strong consumer protections – and that customers should have confidence that these options will not lead to their exploitation. Jon Cleborne, the leader of Vanguard in Europe, also commented on the topic of discussion. Cleborne highlighted that FCA’s proposals are important for helping more people enjoy the benefits of long-term investing and reach their financial goals. Lastly, Verona Kenny, the chief distribution officer at Aberdeen Adviser, reported that over 40% of individuals acknowledged that they have done little to prepare financially for retirement. Based on her argument, the new changes appear to be the best opportunity in a generation to address this issue. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This is due to how they are offering exposure to real-world assets like stocks, commodities, and fiat currencies. Of course, all on-chain. These tokens allow users to trade and invest without actually owning the underlying assets. Subsequently, opening up a new frontier of financial flexibility and innovation. In this article, we will be looking at three low-cap synthetic asset tokens that are quietly building in the background. Low cap, which offers traders solid entry before price surge. With unique tech, community governance, and real DeFi potential, these tokens may be flying under the radar now, but definitely when the market kick off, they could be positioned for growth as synthetic markets mature.

      "description": "Arbitrum price has formed a double-bottom pattern pointing to an eventual rebound in July. The ARB token was trading at $0.3600 on Monday, up from the double-bottom point at $0.2600. This price is approximately 28% below the July high and 70% below its 2024 high of $1.2400. Arbitrum price technical analysis The 12-hour chart shows that the ARB token price has crashed in the past few months, moving from a high of $1.2400 in November last year to the current $0.3595. Most recently, the token crashed from last month’s high of $0.5055 as the recovery faded. On the positive side, Arbitrum price has formed a giant double-bottom pattern at $0.2600 and a neckline point at $0.5055. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. Arbitrum price has moved slightly above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. The two lines of the MACD have pointed upwards and are about to cross the zero line. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the neckline at $0.5054, up by 42% above the current level. This price coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement point. A break above that level will signal more gains, potentially to the 50% retracement level at $0.7438, up by 106% from the current level. A drop below the double-bottom point at $0.2600 will invalidate the bullish view. Arbitrum token chart | Source: TradingView Arbitrum network strength and risks remain Meanwhile, internal data shows that the Arbitrum network is doing relatively well this year. The number of active addresses has jumped by 11% in the last seven days to over 12.7 million. Similarly, the number of active addresses jumped by 22% to over 1.356 million. The same happened in the last 30 days when the number of addresses jumped by14% to 51.6 million. Its active addresses jumped to over 3.5 million. Another data shows that the daily active addresses have jumped by over 311k this month, up by 232k last month. More data showed that Arbitrum supply jumped by 4.2% in the lst 30 days to over $6.7 billion. This increase happened as the number of stablecoin addresses rose by 3% to 1.4 million. More data reveals that the adjusted stablecoin volume dropped slightly to $46.7 billion, while the number of transactions fell by 6% to $46.7 billion. Arbitrum has become a major player in the layer-2 industry, ranking as the second-largest player after Base. Further data shows that the decentralized exchange (DEX) volume stood at $308 million in the last 24 hours, bringing the 30-day value to over $17.80 billion. The biggest players in the ecosystem are Uniswap, Fluid, PancakeSwap, and Camelot. A key challenge facing the Arbitrum token is its regular unlocks . Its unlocks over 479,068 tokens worth over $172,000 each day, and over 93.2 million worth $33.6 million each month. Arbitrum has a circulating supply of 4.96 billion and a total supply of 10 billion.

      "title": "Spanish Coffee Chain Vanadi approves €1B Bitcoin bet",
      "description": "The board of directors of Vanadi Coffee, a publicly traded coffee chain headquartered in Alicante, Spain, has just signed off on a plan to see the company invest up to €1 billion — roughly $1.17 billion — in Bitcoin. The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around €5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth — Spain’s growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises — Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi’s stock price went parabolic following the company’s Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: “Similar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.” The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi’s had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of €3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over €1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi’s ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi’s daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi’s small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi’s management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It’s not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A €1 billion Bitcoin bet on a café chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?
