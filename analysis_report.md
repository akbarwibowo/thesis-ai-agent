    # NARRATIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
    Emerging Narrative: Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI) and AI Agents

The most significant emerging narrative in the cryptocurrency market is the rapid development and integration of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI) and AI Agents. This narrative centers on leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized intelligence economy, fostering open competition, and enabling autonomous AI agents to perform various functions across the crypto ecosystem. This synergy between AI and blockchain is seen as the next frontier, driving innovation and reshaping traditional digital paradigms.

At its core, DeAI aims to build a meritocratic ecosystem for AI development where contributions are incentivized and validated collaboratively, moving beyond centralized control [811, 900, 908, 912, 998]. This involves transforming AI models and services into decentralized, token-driven networks.

Several key projects and players are driving this narrative:
*   **Bittensor (TAO)** is a prominent network focused on decentralized AI, enhancing AI model validation and utility through interoperability and incentivizing contributions via its TAO token [15, 23, 817, 906, 912, 926].
*   **Warden** is bridging AI and blockchain to create smarter decentralized applications, including a modular, intent-centric Layer-1 blockchain designed for secure, cross-chain AI applications [338, 745, 809, 975, 985, 986].
*   **GOKITEAI** is developing an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain specifically for AI applications [810].
*   **TEN** is positioned as Ethereumâ€™s entertainment layer, enabling AI-powered games and encrypted logic on-chain, and providing an encrypted Layer 2 solution for confidential DeFi and AI [274, 749].
*   Other notable projects include **SingularityNET ($AGIX)** for decentralized AI marketplaces, **MindHive ($MindHive)** as the fuel for on-chain intelligence, **Bless Network** which uses AI-powered tasks for token buybacks, and platforms like **Recall** and **Rivalz** building AI agent ecosystems [333, 338, 910, 917, 943, 981]. New tokens like **$HINT** and **$BID** are also emerging as economic layers for AI x crypto [987, 993].

The primary drivers behind this emerging narrative are multifaceted:
*   **Decentralization and Incentives:** The model of decentralized AI networks, particularly through token incentives, fosters open competition and collaborative validation, accelerating innovation and democratizing access to AI development [900, 906, 908, 912, 928].
*   **New Applications and AI Agents:** The development of specialized AI agents is creating novel use cases, such as AI agents for seamless token swaps [974], personal token checkers for smarter trading [975, 986], and agents that live, think, and connect within digital worlds [981]. This also extends to transforming yield farming with AI and Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) [865], and shifting towards

### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bittensor

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol that establishes a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core objective is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, enabling a trustless, open, and transparent environment for AI consumers and producers. The project aims to solve the problem of centralization in AI development, allowing standalone engineers to monetize their work directly and fostering the proliferation of diverse intelligence systems, which are currently limited by the need to train large, monolithic models in a winner-take-all competition.

### Technology & Use Case
Bittensor's core technology is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers that continuously and asynchronously share machine intelligence representations. In this network, machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute. The network employs a sophisticated peer-ranking system where participants learn the value of their neighbors' outputs. These scores accumulate on a digital ledger, and high-ranking peers receive monetary rewards in the form of additional network weight.

The project incorporates an incentive mechanism designed to resist collusion, rewarding honestly selected weights. This mechanism includes:
*   **Consensus**: Rewards are limited to peers who have achieved consensus, defined as having non-zero edges from more than 50 percent of the network's stake. This ensures that inflation is directed towards peers trusted by the majority.
*   **Bonds**: A speculation-based reward system where peers accumulate bonds in other peers they rank. This mechanism incentivizes participants to bond with peers they expect to perform well, similar to speculation in traditional equities, thereby increasing their own inflation.

The TAO token serves as the native cryptocurrency, used to reward contributors for the informational value they add to the collective. It also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network and tune its activities to their specific needs. The use case is compelling as it directly addresses significant challenges in the AI industry, such as centralization and the monetization of diverse AI contributions, by creating a decentralized, incentivized marketplace for intelligence.

To ensure interoperability between various model types and input data, Bittensor requires a common encoding of inputs and outputs, utilizing tensor modalities. The network can be partitioned into disjoint graphs based on these modalities, with a standard output shape [batch_size, sequence_dim, output_dim] for consistency.

### Tokenomics
Bittensor has a `total_supply` and `max_supply` of 21,000,000 TAO tokens. The current `circulating_supply` is 9,437,805 TAO. The tokenomics model is inflationary, designed to incentivize participation and value creation within the network. High-ranking peers are 

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network.
- Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- Standalone engineers cannot directly monetize their work and what results is centralization where a small set of large corporations control access to the best artificial intelligence (OpenAI [2020]).
- The proliferation of diverse intelligence systems is limited by the need to train large monolithic models to succeed in a winner-take-all competition.
- A new commodity needs a new type of market (` 1 `). This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems.
- A network of computers that share representations continuously and asynchronously, peer-to-peer (P2P) across the internet.
- Peers rank each other by training neural networks which learn the value of their neighbors. Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- The solution is an incentive mechanism that maximally rewards honestly selected weights, making the system resistant to collusion of up to 50 percent of the network weight.
- We extended the naive ranking method to evade collusion with an incentive function I ( W , S ) \ I(W, S) \: I ( W , S ) which limits reward to peers that have not reached consensus in the network.
- We define peers who have reached consensus as those with non-zero edges from more than 50 percent of stake in the network.
- We introduce these incentives by adapting the inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward in the form of bonds B.
- peers accumulate bonds in the peers they rank, thus bonding themselves to those that they are connected to.
- Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves.
- Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective.
- TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs.
- Distribution of rewards and network ownership to users in direct proportion to the value they have added
- A common encoding of inputs and outputs is required for the various model types and input types to interact. The use of tensor modalities can be used to partition the network into disjoint graphs.
- For consistency, we can use a standard output shape across the network [batch_size, sequence_dim, output_dim]
- total_supply: 21000000.0
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- circulating_supply: 9437805.0
- high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- peers can only attain inflation by working to attract votes from the majority
- peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves.
- The peer defines its dataset D i \ D_{i} \: D i
- At each training iteration, the peer conditionally broadcasts batches of examples from D i \ D_{i} \: D i to its peers x = [batch_size,sequence_length, input_size].
- The responses F ( x ) = [. ] \: F ( x ) = [. ] each of the common shape f j ( x ) \ f_{j}(x)\: f j ( x ) = [batch_size, sequence_length, output_size] are joined using the gating function and used as input to the local model f i \ f_{i} \: f i
- Comparison against the target labels produces a loss-gradient L F \ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathcal{F}} \: F L which back-propagates through fi and out to the network
- During 2 and 3 the peers learn the weights for their row w i , j W \ w_{i,j} \in W \: w i , j W by measuring the value of the signals produced by their peers.
- At distinct time-step t participants submit changes to the weights Î” W i \ \Delta W_{i} \: Î” W i to update the ranking R, inflation I, consensus term C, and bond distributions Î´ B \ \delta B \: Î´ B
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR.
- Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.
- Eventually, successful models should accept inputs from any modality and process them into a useful representation.

## Internet computer
### Fundamental Analysis

## Internet Computer (ICP) Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary

Internet Computer (IC) is a revolutionary blockchain project developed by the DFINITY Foundation, aiming to extend the public internet into a decentralized global computing platform. It seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional smart contract platforms, such as high transaction costs, slow speeds, and limited storage, by enabling smart contracts (called "canisters") to run at web speed with unrestrictive capacities. The core problem IC addresses is the current hybrid nature of many decentralized applications (dApps), which often rely on centralized cloud services for their frontends, thus compromising true decentralization. IC aims to allow entire applications, including their web interfaces, to be hosted end-to-end on the blockchain, thereby realizing the full vision of Web3.

### Technology & Use Case

The Internet Computer's core technology is a radical new blockchain design consisting of a set of cryptographic protocols that connect independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute "canisters," which are general-purpose, tamperproof, and autonomous smart contracts capable of storing data, performing complex computations, and directly serving web pages to end-users. This "complete technology stack" eliminates the need for traditional cloud hosting services, offering a truly decentralized alternative. Compared to existing platforms, IC is designed to be more cost-effective, provide higher throughput and lower latency, and be more scalable by allowing the network to grow in capacity by adding more nodes. It also offers flexible mutability policies for smart contracts, ranging from immutable to unilaterally upgradable.

The primary utility of the ICP token is multifaceted:
1.  **Network Governance**: ICP tokens are used for governance, allowing community members to participate in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as the Network Nervous System (NNS). Voting power is determined by the amount of ICP staked in the NNS, enabling decisions on network topology, protocol upgrades, and subnet creation.
2.  **Production of Cycles for Compute**: ICP can be converted into "cycles," which act as the transaction fee (gas) to access and utilize the network's computational and storage resources. Cycles are burned after use, introducing a deflationary mechanism.
3.  **Rewarding Users**: ICP is used to incentivize users for participating in and securing the network.

The use case for IC is compelling as it directly addresses critical shortcomings of current blockchain infrastructure, aiming to enable fully decentralized applications that are performant, scalable, and cost-efficient, without reliance on centralized cloud providers. This vision of a "Web3" where applications are entirely controlled by users and run on decentralized platforms is a significant advancement.

### Tokenomics

The Internet Computer's native token is ICP. As of the provided data, the `market_cap` and `fully_diluted_valuation` are both 3,001,666,096, with a `total_supply` and `circulating_supply` of 535,940,261.4982716. This indicates that the circulating supply is currently equal to the total supply, suggesting no immediate unlock schedule for a large portion of tokens, though a `max_supply` is not specified, implying potential for future issuance or a dynamic supply model.

A key deflationary mechanism is the conversion of ICP into "cycles" for transaction fees, which are then burned. This "reverse-gas model" means developers pre-pay costs in cycles, which are consumed as applications run. ICP is also used as rewards for network participants, which could introduce inflationary pressure, balanced by the burning mechanism from cycles. The governance model, based on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via the NNS, incentivizes staking of ICP tokens, potentially reducing circulating supply available on exchanges.

### Team & Roadmap

The Internet Computer project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams and is built by the DFINITY Foundation. The project has attracted significant investment, raising a total of $121 million from prominent investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital, which speaks to the credibility and backing of the team.

A major milestone was the public launch of the Internet Computer on May 10, 2021, when DFINITY released its source code and the ICP utility token, enabling community governance. While a detailed future roadmap is not explicitly provided in the whitepaper (v1.4, December 18, 2023), the document outlines the ambitious long-term vision of "realizing the vision of Web3" by providing a complete technology stack for decentralized applications. The continuous development is evidenced by the whitepaper's versioning and recent developer activity, including 55,572 additions and -36,372 deletions in code, and 567 commits over the last four weeks, indicating active ongoing development and refinement of the protocol.

### Proof
- Internet Computer (IC) is the worlds first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the worlds computing platform, in a decentralized manner. Internet Computer sets to revolutionalize the design of the crypto economy, with an aim to overhaul traditional software services.
- The Internet Computer (IC), which is a radical new design of blockchain that unleashes the full potential of smart contracts, overcoming the limitations of smart contracts on traditional blockchains with respect to speed, storage costs, and computational capacity. This allows smart contracts for the rst time to implement fully decentralized applications that are hosted end to end on blockchain.
- Smart contracts running on today's blockchain platforms, including all the popular ones (such as Ethereum), su er from many limitations, such as high transaction and storage costs, slow computational speed, and the inability to serve frontends to users. As a result, many popular blockchain applications are not fully decentralized but are hybrids where most of the application is hosted on traditional cloud platforms and call out to smart contracts on a blockchain for a small part of their overall functionality. Unfortunately, this renders such applications non-decentralized, and opens them to many of the drawbacks of traditional cloud-hosted applications, such as being at the mercy of cloud providers, and being vulnerable to many single points of failure.
- The IC consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that connects independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute \canisters", the IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters can store data, perform very general computations on that data, and provide a complete technology stack, serving web pages directly to end users.
- Computational and storage costs are covered by a \reverse-gas model", where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC. ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol.
- Compared to existing smart contract platforms, the IC is designed to: bemore cost e ective , in particular, allowing applications to compute and store data at a fraction of the cost of previous platforms; provide higher throughput and lower latency for processing smart contract transac- tions; bemore scalable , in particular, the IC can process unbounded volumes of smart con- tract data and computation natively because it can grow in capacity by adding more nodes to the network.
- The IC allows a range of mutability policies for smart contracts, ranging from purely immutable to unilaterally upgradable, with other options in between.
- In addition to providing a smart contract platform, the IC is designed to act as a complete technology stack , such that systems and services can be built that run entirely on the IC. In particular, smart contracts on the IC can service HTTP requests created by end users, so that smart contracts can directly serve interactive web experiences. This means that systems and services can be created without relying on corporate cloud hosting services or private servers, thus providing all of the bene ts of smart contracts in a true end-to-end fashion. Realizing the vision of Web3.
- ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles: 1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI 2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network
- The IC's permission model is a hybrid model , obtaining the e ciency of a permissioned protocol while o ering many of the bene ts of a decentralized PoS protocol. This hybrid model is called a DAO-controlled network and (roughly speaking) works as follows: each subnet runs a permissioned consensus protocol, but a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) determines which entities provide replicas, con gures the topology of the network, provides a public-key infrastructure, and controls which version of the protocol is deployed to the replicas. The IC's DAO is called the network nervous system (NNS) , and is based on a PoS, so that all decisions taken by the NNS are made by community members whose voting power is determined by how much of the IC's native governance 5 token they have staked in the NNS (see Section 1. 8 for more on this token).

## Virtuals protocol
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis of Virtuals Protocol

### Project Summary
Virtuals Protocol is an AI x Metaverse Protocol focused on building the future of virtual interactions. It aims to solve the challenges of standardization, centralization, and limited interoperability in digital commerce, particularly for autonomous AI agents and human participants. The core problem addressed is the potential for compounding information loss in multi-agent interactions due to misinterpretation, hallucination, or incomplete data exchange. To counter this, the project introduces the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized, blockchain-based framework designed for decentralized autonomous systems. ACP facilitates secure, verifiable, and tamper-resistant interactions through a structured four-phase model.

### Technology & Use Case
Virtuals Protocol's core technology is the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), which leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to enable safe, secure, trustable, and verifiable autonomous agent commerce. The protocol is built upon four fundamental principles: Framework and Capability Agnosticism (allowing any system to participate regardless of its internal architecture), Atomic Phases with Defined States (ensuring clear entry/exit conditions for transactions), Deterministic Outcomes and Single Source of Truth (providing clear success/failure conditions and eliminating ambiguity), and Cryptographically Verifiable Agreements (creating an immutable audit trail).

ACP operates through a four-phase interaction model:
1.  **Request Phase**: Establishes initial interaction, mandates clear identification of participants, standardizes request formats, and includes an explicit accept/reject decision point with timeout mechanisms.
2.  **Negotiation Phase**: Critical stage for establishing concrete terms of agreement, centered around a Proof of Agreement (PoA). Terms are standardized to include agreed service, constraints, compensation, and evaluation requirements, with multi-signature schemes ensuring agreement integrity.
3.  **Transaction Phase**: Handles the execution of agreed terms, involving payment to a contract wallet and delivery of service to a contract wallet, with both withheld until the evaluation phase is complete.
4.  **Evaluation Phase**: Provides mechanisms for quality assessment and performance feedback, crucial for reputation building and system improvement. It supports both human and agent evaluators and enables a sophisticated marketplace for specialized evaluator agents. These evaluator agents receive compensation, typically a percentage of the transaction value (2-3%), which incentivizes their development and maintenance, fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem.

The primary utility of the project's token, while not explicitly named in the provided text, is implied through the economic model for evaluator agents. The protocol enables a fee structure where evaluators receive compensation for their services, suggesting the token would be used for these transaction fees and rewards, thereby creating incentives for participation and maintaining the quality of the network.

### Tokenomics
Based on the provided data:
*   **Market Cap**: 1,138,236,867
*   **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)**: 1,737,421,674
*   **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000
*   **Max Supply**: 1,000,000,000
*   **Circulating Supply**: 655,129,888.0885236

The project has a fixed maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. The whitepaper mentions an economic model where evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3%) as compensation. However, details regarding token distribution (e.g., to team, investors, community) or specific inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond this fee structure are not provided in the available documentation.

**Team**: The `developer_data` indicates 

### Proof
- An AI x Metaverse Protocol that is building the future of virtual interactions
- To address these challenges, we present the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized framework designed for many-to-many decentralized autonomous systems. ACP leverages blockchain technology to secure and streamline information exchange while introducing a four-phase interaction model - Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluation - implemented via smart contracts. This ensures transparent, verifiable, and tamper- resistant interactions.
- The landscape for commerce and regular everyday transactions lacks standardization, is centralized or makes assumptions about participant capabilities (either humans only or autonomous systems only), limiting interoperability and adoption. This paper presents the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP). ACP addresses these challenges by providing a framework and system agnostic protocol that Preprint. defines the fundamental phases and requirements for safe, secure and verifiable autonomous agent commerce, by building on the strengths of the blockchain beyond just payments.
- Importantly, the secure and immutable storing of agreements coupled with the evaluation phase in the proposed standardization and protocol also address the compounding effects of information loss in agent interactions.
- ACP is constructed upon four fundamental principles that govern its design and implementation. These principles ensure the protocols flexibility, reliability, and broad applicability across different autonomous systems. Commerce and transactions should be safe, secure, trustable and verifiable. But it should not be more complicated than necessary. Framework and Capability Agnosticism. This principle establishes that the protocol makes no assumptions about the internal implementation of participating entities. This deliberate design choice enables any system, regardless of its underlying architecture or capabilities, to participate in the protocol as long as it adheres to the specified interaction patterns. A decentralized solution has to be framework and capability agnostic. This principle mandates that each phase within the protocol must have explicitly defined entry and exit conditions. This atomicity ensures that transactions cannot exist in intermediate or undefined states, providing clarity and certainty about the interaction and transactions progress at any given moment. The defined states also fully align with agentic principles where states should be clearly defined at any moment to enable agents to best make decisions on what should be done next. Deterministic Outcomes and Single Source of Truth. Outcome-based principle establishes that each phase must have clearly defined success and failure conditions. This deterministic nature ensures that all participants can independently arrive at the same conclusion about a phases status, eliminating ambiguity and reducing the potential for disputes. This principle requires that agreements within the protocol must be cryptographically verifiable. This verification requirement creates an immutable audit trail of the transactions progres- sion and agreed terms. This ensures that all participants can independently validate the state of any transaction. Importantly for autonomous agents, this also means that any participant can securely recall and retrieve past transactions and past terms.
- Figure 1 shows an overview of the flow of informatio, interaction and the different phases of ACP. 1 Request Phase The Request Phase establishes the initial interaction between participants. This phase defines the participants of the proposed transaction and determines preliminary compatibility.
- 2 Negotiation Phase The Negotiation Phase represents the critical stage where participating entities establish concrete terms of agreement through a deterministic process. This phase implements mechanisms to ensure that all terms are unambiguously specified and cryptographically verifiable. At the core of the Negotiation Phase lies the Proof of Agreement (PoA). The PoA serves as an immutable record of the agreed negotiated terms and will be used in the Evaluation Phase.
- 3 Transaction Phase The Transaction Phase handles the execution of agreed-upon terms through secure operations. This makes use of existing blockchain transactions, and uses the contract to check the execution of these transactions. The two transactions that must occur is the: Payment to the contract wallet/address Delivery of the service to the contract wallet/address Both payment and the service are withheld, until the evaluation phase is complete.
- 4 Evaluation Phase The Evaluation Phase provides mechanisms for quality assessment and performance feedback, enabling reputation building and system improvement. The Evaluation Phase represents the protocols commitment to continuous learning improvement and accountability, necessary for an agentic and autonomous society, through an evaluation and feedback system.
- To ensure sustainable operation of high-quality evaluator agents, the protocol enables implementation of a fee structure where evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or set value part of the contract agreement) as compensation for their services. This economic model: Creates incentives for developers to build and maintain sophisticated evaluation agents Justifies the computational and operational costs of running evaluation services Encourages specialization and continuous improvement of evaluation capabilities Enables a self-sustaining ecosystem of evaluation services

## Origintrail
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of OriginTrail (TRAC)

### Project Summary
OriginTrail is an ecosystem focused on building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). Its primary goal is to combat misinformation in the AI era by ensuring the origin and enabling the discoverability of critical knowledge and real-world assets (RWAs). The project aims to create a "Verifiable Internet for AI" by leveraging its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and NeuroWeb blockchain, providing AI-powered search and solutions for both enterprises and individuals.

### Technology & Use Case
OriginTrail's core technology revolves around the **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)**, which serves as an infrastructure designed to bring trusted knowledge sharing to enterprises and individuals. The DKG is proposed as a novel approach to ensure the provenance, integrity, and verifiability of information used by AI systems. It addresses critical challenges in AI, such as misinformation (hallucinations), data ownership, intellectual property rights, and biases inherent in AI technologies. The project synergizes neural and symbolic AI approaches with Web3 technologies, specifically through a **Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework**. This framework enhances AI models by fetching facts from external sources organized within the DKG, thereby improving accuracy and reliability by limiting generation to retrieved inputs. The DKG also introduces incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of high-quality knowledge, which is crucial as AI-generated content is expected to surpass human-generated content, making verifiable real-world data increasingly valuable.

While the specific utility of the TRAC token is not explicitly detailed in the provided text regarding its direct function within the DKG or NeuroWeb, the whitepaper highlights the need for a "two-pronged incentivization model" for knowledge sharing: "Incentivizing open knowledge creation" and "Monetizing proprietary knowledge." This strongly implies that the TRAC token would be used to facilitate these incentives, rewarding contributions of high-quality, verifiable knowledge to the DKG and enabling transactions for proprietary data access. The use case is compelling given the growing concerns around AI hallucinations, data provenance, and bias, positioning OriginTrail as a foundational layer for trustworthy AI applications.

### Tokenomics
As of the provided data, OriginTrail (TRAC) has a **market capitalization of $206,285,077** and a **fully diluted valuation of $206,472,159**. The **total supply** and **max supply** are both **500,000,000 TRAC**, indicating a fixed maximum supply. The **circulating supply** is **499,546,955.602 TRAC**, which is very close to the total/max supply, suggesting a high percentage of tokens are already in circulation. The provided data does not detail the specific distribution of tokens among the team, investors, or community, nor does it explicitly mention any inflationary or deflationary mechanisms beyond the fixed maximum supply.

### Team & Roadmap
OriginTrail was established by **Å½iga Drev, TomaÅ¾ Levak, and Branimir RakiÄ‡**. Their vision was to build and implement the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) to enable trusted knowledge sharing globally. The team, through Trace Labs (the core developers), has spearheaded partnerships with notable organizations such including British Standards Institution (BSI), SCAN, Polkadot, Parity, Walmart, World Federation of Hemophilia, Oracle, the EU Commission's Next Generation Internet, and Microsoft Entrepreneurship for Positive Impact. Trace Labs also became a founding shareholder in Umanitek, which builds on the DKG's symbolic-AI foundation for information trust and data ownership.

The project's roadmap is outlined in phases, with the current focus on the **Metcalfe phase**. This phase aims to create the world's largest verifiable Internet for AI, targeting 100 billion Knowledge Assets and a 100,000x scalability increase. It seeks to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and achieve autonomous DKG growth, driven by "knowledge mining" and "knowledge signaling" capabilities introduced in the Genesis part of this phase. Following Genesis and a transition to an AI-native V8, the **Convergence stage** will unlock further capabilities, including autonomous knowledge mining and an autonomous DKG, where new knowledge is added with minimal human involvement, and AI agents perform knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG. The roadmap demonstrates clear ambition and a phased approach to achieving its vision of a self-sustaining, verifiable AI internet.

### Proof
- "What is OriginTrail (TRAC)? OriginTrail is an ecosystem building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). It addresses the challenge of misinformation in the AI era by ensuring the origin of information and enabling discoverability of the world's most important knowledge and real-world assets (RWAs). OriginTrail is creating a verifiable Internet for decentralized AI by empowering world-class brands and builders. It utilizes its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph and NeuroWeb blockchain to deliver AI-powered search and solutions for enterprises and individuals worldwide."
- "This whitepaper presents a vision for the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through the concept of a Verifiable Internet for AI, leveraging the synergies of crypto, internet, and AI technologies. It introduces the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), a novel approach to ensure the provenance, integrity, and verifiability of information utilized by AI systems. It aims to address the challenges posed by misinformation, data ownership, intellectual property rights, and biases inherent in AI technologies, by synergizing neural and symbolic AI approaches with Web3 technologies."
- "The dRAG advances the model by organizing external sources in a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to use."
- "The importance of it has also been highlighted by the Turing Award winner in the field of Deep Learning, Yann LeCun: "The way you train that (AI) system will have to be crowdsourced if you want it to be a repository of all human knowledge, all humans need to contribute to it." Even though the need may exist, open knowledge is often poised with the tragedy of the commons dilemma. The motivation to contribute to open knowledge can be perceived as a less desirable option to growing a knowledge base in private stores. This opens a strong requirement for a two-pronged incentivization model: Incentivizing open knowledge creation - incentivizing publishing of open knowledge, especially one in the public domain, turns the tragedy of common considerations into a race for capturing incentives. If you do not add open knowledge - another actor will. Monetizing proprietary knowledge - allowing business models to develop on the basis of owning a piece of data or knowledge that is not in the public domain (e. anonymized personal data or companys know-how)."

As the name of the phase suggests, it seeks to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the Genesis knowledge foundation being created by organizations and individuals alike. The Genesis part of the Metcalfes phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities to drive constant growth of the verifiable Internet. Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any blind spots in the knowledge they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance with knowledge signaling."

## Bittensor
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bittensor (TAO)

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol designed to power a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core vision is to establish a pure market for artificial intelligence, enabling consumers and producers of AI to interact in a trustless, open, and transparent environment. The protocol facilitates collaborative training of machine learning models, rewarding participants in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute. TAO also provides external access to the network, allowing users to extract information and influence its activities.

### Technology & Use Case
Bittensor's core technology revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market built on a digital ledger. This network allows machine intelligence to be measured and rewarded by other intelligence systems, irrespective of the specific task or dataset used for training. The project aims to address the centralization prevalent in AI development, where large corporations control access to advanced AI, and to provide a mechanism for standalone engineers to monetize their work directly. By creating an open-source repository of machine intelligence, Bittensor seeks to foster permissionless innovation on a global scale.

The TAO token is integral to the Bittensor ecosystem. It serves as the reward mechanism for machine learning models that contribute informational value, granting them additional weight in the network. Furthermore, TAO facilitates external access, allowing users to interact with and tune the network. The token's utility is essential for incentivizing participation, enabling a decentralized market for AI, and ensuring that value is distributed proportionally to contributions.

### Tokenomics
The Bittensor network has a `total_supply` and `max_supply` of 21,000,000 TAO tokens. The current `circulating_supply` is 9,437,805 TAO. The tokenomics model is inflationary, with new TAO tokens being minted and distributed as rewards to peers who contribute value and help minimize the network's loss objective. The distribution of these rewards is tied to a peer-ranking system and a bonding mechanism, where peers accumulate bonds in others they rank highly, speculating on their future value. This system ensures that rewards and network ownership are distributed to users in direct proportion to the value they add.

### Team & Roadmap
While specific details about the core team members are not provided in the given data, the project exhibits active development. The `developer_data` indicates a healthy level of community engagement and ongoing work, with 388 forks, 1175 stars, 1774 pull requests merged, and 108 pull request contributors. Recent activity includes 2977 additions and -1818 deletions in code over the last 4 weeks, with 5 commits.

The roadmap for Bittensor focuses on expanding the network's capabilities through tensor standardization and modality integration. Initially, the network will be seeded with a single modality (TEXT) and gradually expanded to include others such as IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. The long-term vision includes integrating combinations of these modalities (e.g., TEXT-IMAGE) to bridge into a multi-modality landscape, with incentives designed to encourage connections between different modalities. The goal is for successful models to eventually accept inputs from any modality and process them into useful representations.

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network.
- Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective.
- TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs.
- Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them.
- The production of machine intelligence has come to rely almost entirely on a system of benchmarking... the mechanism is weak in situations where the introduction of markets would enable it to excel.
- Standalone engineers cannot directly monetize their work and what results is centralization where a small set of large corporations control access to the best artificial intelligence (OpenAI [2020]).
- An open-source repository of machine intelligence, accessible to anyone, anywhere, thus creating the conditions for open and permission-less innovation on a global internet scale.
- Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- The chain measures trust, making it difficult for peers to attain rewards without providing value to the majority.
- Researchers can directly monetize machine intelligence work and consumers can directly purchase it.
- total_supply: 21000000.0
- max_supply: 21000000.0

- Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- peers can only attain inflation by working to attract votes from the majority
- Distribution of rewards and network ownership to users in direct proportion to the value they have added
- peers accumulate bonds in the peers they rank, thus bonding themselves to those that they are connected to.
- the chain redistributes the normal incentive scores Î” S = B T I

- pull_request_contributors: 108
- code_additions_deletions_4_weeks: {'additions': 2977, 'deletions': -1818}
- commit_count_4_weeks: 5
- At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.
- Incentives to connect modalities can be integrated with the same trust scaling suggested in section (` 2 `).
- Eventually, successful models should accept inputs from any modality and process them into a useful representation.

## Chutes
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis: Chutes

## Project Summary
Based on the provided data, Chutes is categorized within the 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Bittensor Ecosystem', and 'Bittensor Subnets' sectors. This suggests that Chutes operates as an AI-focused project, likely a specialized subnet, within the broader Bittensor network. However, the project's `description` field is empty, and no `link_to_whitepaper` is provided. Therefore, a detailed understanding of what Chutes specifically is, its core mission, or the particular problem it aims to solve cannot be ascertained from the available information.

## Technology & Use Case
Given its categorization, Chutes is presumed to leverage AI technology within the Bittensor framework. As a 'Bittensor Subnet', its technology would likely involve a decentralized network of AI models or services. However, without a project description or whitepaper, the specific core technology, its unique approach, or the primary utility of the Chutes token remain undefined. Consequently, it is not possible to assess whether its use case is compelling or essential for its ecosystem, as the use case itself is not detailed in the provided data.

## Tokenomics
The tokenomics data for Chutes provides several key figures:
*   **Market Capitalization (Market Cap):** 90,353,241
*   **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** 90,353,241
*   **Total Supply:** 1,274,227.302660601
*   **Circulating Supply:** 1,274,227.302660601
*   **Max Supply:** 21,000,000.0

Notably, the `total_supply` and `circulating_supply` are identical, indicating that all currently existing tokens are in circulation. Similarly, the `market_cap` equals the `fully_diluted_valuation`, which further supports the notion that the current circulating supply represents the entire current token issuance. However, the `max_supply` of 21,000,000.0 is significantly higher than the current `total_supply` of 1,274,227.302660601. This substantial difference suggests that there is a large potential for future token issuance, which could lead to inflationary pressure as more tokens are released into circulation up to the maximum supply. Information regarding token distribution (e.g., allocations for team, investors, community) or specific inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond the max supply cap is not available in the provided data.

## Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the Chutes project's team background and future roadmap is not available in the provided data. The `developer_data` shows zero activity across all tracked metrics, including `forks`, `stars`, `subscribers`, `total_issues`, `closed_issues`, `pull_requests_merged`, `pull_request_contributors`, `code_additions_deletions_4_weeks`, and `commit_count_4_weeks`. This lack of public developer activity or explicit roadmap details makes it impossible to assess the team's experience, the project's development progress, or its future strategic direction.

## Bitcoin
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bitcoin

### Project Summary
Bitcoin is presented as the first successful internet money, designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its primary aim is to enable online payments to be sent directly between parties without the need for a central bank or financial institution, thereby addressing the inherent weaknesses of trust-based models in traditional commerce. It seeks to provide a secure, verifiable, and immutable means of exchange, independent of any central authority, by solving the double-spending problem through a decentralized network.

### Technology & Use Case
Bitcoin's core technology relies on a peer-to-peer network utilizing a hash-based proof-of-work system. Transactions are timestamped by hashing them into an ongoing chain, forming a record that is computationally impractical to alter. The network employs the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. The proof-of-work mechanism serves as a 

### Proof
- Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency.
- The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way.
- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
- We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
- It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.
- Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes.
- The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
- Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.
- What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.
- Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.
- To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.
- Privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.
- Bitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- total_supply: 19894493.0
- circulating_supply: 19894493.0
- By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
- The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.
- Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
- It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.

## Ethereum
### Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Ethereum is a global, open-source platform designed for decentralized applications. Its core vision is to function as a "world computer," enabling anyone to build applications in a decentralized manner, with all states and data distributed and publicly accessible.

### Technology & Use Case
Ethereum's core technology revolves around its support for smart contracts, allowing developers to program digital value through code. This capability has led to the development of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including various tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges. The native coin of the blockchain, Ether (ETH), is essential for network operations. All transactions and smart contract executions on Ethereum require a fee, known as "Gas," which is paid entirely in ETH. Gas represents the computational effort required for an operation, with more complex operations demanding higher gas fees. This mechanism makes ETH an indispensable utility token within the Ethereum ecosystem, as it is required for any interaction with the network.

### Tokenomics
The provided data indicates that Ethereum has a total supply of approximately 120,712,080.57 ETH, which also matches its circulating supply. The data does not specify a maximum supply, suggesting that there might not be a hard cap on the total number of ETH that can exist. Information regarding the distribution of tokens among the team, investors, or community, as well as specific inflationary or deflationary mechanisms beyond the gas fee payment, is not detailed in the provided data.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not contain specific information about the Ethereum team's background or a detailed future roadmap. However, the developer activity metrics indicate a highly active and engaged development community. The project boasts a significant number of forks (19,618), stars (44,422), and subscribers (2,195) on its repositories.

## Axelar
### Fundamental Analysis

# Axelar Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Axelar is an interoperability platform designed to provide secure interchain communication. It aims to simplify decentralized application (dApp) interactions by allowing users to interact with any asset or application across various blockchains with a single click. The project positions itself as the "Stripe for Web3," offering a simple API atop a permissionless network to route messages and ensure security.

## Technology & Use Case
Axelar operates as a blockchain that connects other blockchains, utilizing a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for network security. Its core technology involves network validators who produce blocks, participate in multi-party signing, and vote on external chain states. The primary utility of the AXL token is for governance and to pay network transaction fees to validators and tokenholders. A key aspect of its use case is that end-users of the Axelar network do not need to directly hold the AXL token; conversions into AXL and destination-chain tokens are handled on the backend, allowing users to pay gas only once in the source-chain token. This abstraction aims to provide a seamless user experience, making cross-chain interactions more accessible.

## Tokenomics
The AXL token has a total supply of approximately 1.21 billion (1,209,097,402.72 AXL) and a circulating supply of approximately 1.00 billion (1,003,492,003.23 AXL). There is no specified maximum supply, indicating that the supply is not hard-capped. The network's reward mechanism is inflationary, meaning it increases the total supply of AXL. However, the project notes a potential for the supply to become deflationary based on its transaction fee mechanic, suggesting a dynamic supply model influenced by network activity.

## Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the team's background and the project's future roadmap is not available in the provided fundamental data.

### Proof
- Axelar delivers secure interchain communication. That means dApp users can interact with any asset, any application, on any chain, with one click. You can think of it as Stripe for Web3.
- Developers interact with a simple API atop a permissionless network that routes messages and ensures network security via proof-of-stake consensus.
- Axelar is a blockchain that connects blockchains. To do this securely, Axelar network uses proof-of-stake consensus. Network validators produce new blocks, participate in multiparty signing and vote on external chain states.
- The AXL token is used for governance and to pay network transaction fees to validators and tokenholders.
- However, users of the Axelar network do not need to hold the token. Conversions into AXL tokens and destination-chain tokens are handled on the back end, so that users need only pay gas once, in the source-chain token.
- total_supply: 1209097402.71544
- circulating_supply: 1003492003.229372
- max_supply: None
- Axelar network rewards are inflationary they increase the total supply of AXL but there is potential for supply to become deflationary based on the transaction fee mechanic described above

## Lido staked ether
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis: Lido Staked Ether (stETH)

## Project Summary
Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a liquid staking token that represents Ether (ETH) staked with Lido. The project aims to solve the illiquidity problem associated with traditional Ethereum staking, where staked ETH is locked and inaccessible. stETH allows users to earn ETH 2.0 staking rewards while maintaining liquidity and enabling participation in various decentralized finance (DeFi) products.

## Technology & Use Case
stETH tokens are designed to combine the value of the initial ETH deposit with accumulated staking rewards. The core technology involves minting stETH tokens upon deposit of ETH into Lido and burning them when the underlying ETH is redeemed. The stETH token balance is pegged 1:1 to the ETH staked by Lido, and these balances are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards. This mechanism provides a liquid representation of staked ETH. The primary use case for stETH is to allow users to earn staking rewards on their ETH without needing to lock up their assets or run a validator node. Furthermore, stETH can be utilized across the DeFi ecosystem, enabling holders to generate additional yields on their staked assets, which makes its use case compelling by addressing a significant pain point in the Ethereum staking landscape.

## Tokenomics
The tokenomics of stETH are directly tied to the amount of Ether staked through Lido. stETH tokens are minted when users deposit ETH for staking and are burned upon redemption. The token's balance updates daily to reflect staking rewards, effectively increasing the stETH holdings of users over time. As of the provided data, the total supply and circulating supply are identical, indicating that all minted tokens are in circulation. There is no fixed maximum supply, as the supply is dynamic and dependent on the amount of ETH staked and redeemed through the Lido protocol.

## Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the specific team background and future roadmap for Lido Staked Ether is not available in the provided fundamental data. The developer activity metrics, such as forks, stars, subscribers, total issues, closed issues, pull requests merged, pull request contributors, code additions/deletions, and commit count, are all reported as zero or None, suggesting that public developer activity data was not captured or is not publicly available through the provided source.

### Proof
- Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a token that represents your staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit and staking rewards.
- stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed.
- stETH token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido and the tokens balances are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards.
- stETH tokens can be used as one would use ether, allowing you to earn ETH 2. 0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e. yields across decentralised finance products

## Wrapped steth
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Wrapped stETH (wstETH)

### Project Summary
wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH, which is a liquid staking token provided by the Lido protocol. The primary purpose of wstETH is to represent a pro-rata ownership of staked Ethereum (stETH) and its accumulated earnings, but without the daily rebasing mechanism of stETH. This design makes wstETH behave similarly to a c-token, where the underlying value accrues rather than the token balance changing. Lido, the underlying protocol, aims to solve the illiquidity problem associated with staked Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets by providing a liquid token that represents staked collateral and earnings, thereby removing the need for users to run their own staking infrastructure and enabling continued participation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

### Technology & Use Case
wstETH functions as a wrapped token that encapsulates stETH, offering a stable balance that accrues value internally rather than through daily rebase adjustments. This mechanism allows users to hold a token that reflects their staked ETH principal plus earnings, which are realized upon unwrapping wstETH back into stETH. The core utility of wstETH, facilitated by Lido, is to provide liquidity for staked ETH. By issuing a liquid token (stETH, and subsequently wstETH), Lido addresses the challenge of staked assets being locked and illiquid. This enables stakers to maintain exposure to their staked ETH while simultaneously participating in various DeFi protocols, such as lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity, without forfeiting their staking rewards. The minting and burning of wstETH are directly tied to the wrapping and unwrapping of stETH, indicating a direct relationship with the underlying staked asset. This use case is compelling as it enhances capital efficiency for ETH stakers, making their staked assets productive within the broader DeFi ecosystem.

### Tokenomics
wstETH operates with a market capitalization and fully diluted valuation of approximately $15.41 billion. Its total supply and circulating supply are identical, standing at approximately 3.45 million tokens. The data indicates that there is no predefined maximum supply, nor is it explicitly stated as infinite, which is consistent with its nature as a wrapped token whose supply is directly dependent on the amount of stETH being wrapped. The supply mechanism is dynamic: wstETH is minted when stETH is wrapped and burned when stETH is unwrapped. This implies that its supply fluctuates based on user demand for the wrapped version of stETH, rather than through fixed emission schedules or traditional inflationary/deflationary mechanisms. Information regarding the distribution of wstETH to teams, investors, or the community is not available in the provided data.

### Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the development team's background, experience, or specific roles is not available in the provided data. Similarly, there is no explicit roadmap or future development plans outlined. The developer activity metrics provided, such as forks, stars, subscribers, total issues, closed issues, pull requests merged, pull request contributors, code additions/deletions, and commit count over the last four weeks, all show zero activity. This suggests that either the provided data does not capture the relevant development activity for wstETH (which is a wrapped token of Lido's stETH, so core development might be attributed to Lido), or there has been no recent direct development activity specifically on the wstETH contract itself. Without a whitepaper or specific roadmap details, assessing the project's future direction or the team's execution capabilities is not possible based solely on the provided information.

### Proof
- wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. Instead of rebasing, or changing account holdings daily it is similar to a c-token. It represents a pro-rata ownership of the staked ETH (stETH). When someone exits wstETH they are returned principal stETH + stETH earnings. Lido is a liquid staking protocol for POS blockchains. It gives you a liquid token that represents your staked collateral and earnings over time. Lido removes the need to run infrastructure and enabling continued participation in DeFi. wstETH is minted and burned as stETH is wrapped and unwrapped

## Curve dao
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Curve DAO

### Project Summary
Curve DAO is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralized Exchange (DEX) primarily focused on facilitating swaps between assets that are designed to maintain the same value. This addresses a critical need within the DeFi ecosystem for efficient and low-slippage exchanges of wrapped tokens and synthetic assets that mimic the price of underlying real assets. A prominent example is its 3CRV stablecoin pool, comprising DAI, USDT, and USDC, where asset ratios adjust based on market supply and demand, creating arbitrage opportunities. Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens, exemplified by its collaboration with Yearn Finance to create yUSD pools, allowing users to earn yield from underlying assets, swap fees, and CRV token rewards.

### Technology & Use Case
Curve Finance's core technology is an AMM specifically optimized for stablecoin and pegged-asset swaps, distinguishing it from general-purpose AMMs like Uniswap. This specialization allows for highly efficient and low-slippage trades, which is crucial for maintaining peg stability and capital efficiency within the DeFi space. The platform's ability to integrate yield-bearing tokens, as seen with yUSD pools, enhances its utility by offering liquidity providers multiple income streams: yield from the underlying assets, swap fees generated by the pool, and CRV token rewards for yield farming. This multi-faceted yield generation mechanism makes the use case for providing liquidity on Curve compelling and essential for participants seeking optimized returns on stable assets.

### Tokenomics
The Curve DAO Token (CRV) has a maximum supply of 3,030,303,031 tokens. The current total supply stands at approximately 2,284,994,919.85 CRV, with a circulating supply of approximately 1,375,826,279.0 CRV. This indicates that about 45.39% of the maximum supply is currently in circulation. The primary utility of the CRV token, as described, is for yield farming rewards distributed to liquidity providers. Information regarding the specific distribution breakdown (e.g., allocation for team, investors, community) and explicit inflationary or deflationary mechanisms beyond the stated maximum supply is not provided in the available data.

### Team & Roadmap
Detailed information regarding the Curve DAO team's background and a clear roadmap outlining future developments are not available in the provided data. However, developer activity metrics show a history of contributions, with 400 forks, 1061 stars, 105 pull requests merged, and 13 pull request contributors. It is notable that there has been no recorded code additions, deletions, or commit activity in the last four weeks, which could indicate a period of reduced public development activity or a shift in development tracking.

### Proof
- description: 'Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset.'
- description: 'For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.'
- description: 'Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield'

## Zcash
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Zcash

### Project Summary
Zcash is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to provide privacy and selective transparency for transactions. It aims to solve the problem of public transaction visibility inherent in many blockchain systems by allowing users to keep the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction private, while still publishing the transaction on a public blockchain.

### Technology & Use Case
Zcash's core technology is built upon peer-reviewed cryptographic research and an open-source platform derived from Bitcoin Core's codebase. Its primary innovation lies in the use of advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically zero-knowledge proofs, known as zk-SNARKs. These zk-SNARKs enable the network to verify the validity of encrypted transaction information without revealing the actual details, such as the parties involved or the transaction amounts. This allows for a secure ledger of balances while maintaining privacy.

The project offers a compelling use case by providing users with the choice between private (shielded) and public (transparent) transactions. Users can send Zcash privately from a shielded address to another shielded address, or publicly similar to Bitcoin. Furthermore, Zcash supports interoperability between these address types, allowing payments from shielded to transparent addresses (revealing the received balance) and from transparent to shielded addresses (protecting the receiving value). This flexibility caters to varying user needs for privacy.

### Tokenomics
Zcash has a `total_supply` of 16,177,625.1655448 ZEC and a `circulating_supply` of 16,177,351.7280448 ZEC. The `max_supply` is capped at 21,000,000.0 ZEC, similar to Bitcoin, which suggests a controlled emission schedule leading to a finite supply. The provided data does not detail the distribution mechanisms (e.g., for team, investors, or community) or specific inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond the fixed maximum supply.

### Team & Roadmap
The Zcash project was built by a "security-specialized engineering team" and its core cryptographic innovation, zk-SNARKs, was developed by a "team of experienced cryptographers." While the data highlights the expertise of the development team in cryptography and security, specific details about individual team members' backgrounds or a future roadmap outlining project milestones and development plans are not available in the provided information.

### Proof
- Zcash is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions.
- Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.
- Zcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase.
- Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.
- Zcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography.
- These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved.
- Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.
- Zcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin.
- With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly.
- Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value.

Virtuals Protocol has recently established an uptrend. A golden cross, where the 13-period EMA crossed above the 21-period SMA, occurred around 2025-07-07 (EMA 1.5647 > SMA 1.5640). Currently, the price (1.793) is trading above both its 13-period EMA (1.7149) and 21-period SMA (1.6440), reinforcing the established bullish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Virtuals Protocol is currently at 56.86, which places it in the neutral range (between 30 and 70). In the most recent days, the RSI has shown a slight upward trend, moving from 52.12 on 2025-07-16 to 56.86 on 2025-07-20. This indicates a moderate increase in buying momentum, but the asset is not yet in overbought territory.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Virtuals Protocol has been substantial in recent months. In the most recent days, the price increase on 2025-07-17 and 2025-07-18 was confirmed by rising volume (from ~307M to ~386M). However, the subsequent price increase on 2025-07-20 (from 1.7708 to 1.793) occurred on relatively lower volume (~134M to ~137M) compared to the preceding days. This suggests a potential lack of strong buying conviction for the most immediate price movements, despite the overall higher volume levels in recent periods.

### Outlook
Virtuals Protocol is currently in an established uptrend, confirmed by the price trading above both its EMA and SMA, following a recent golden cross. While momentum is positive and within a healthy neutral range, the most recent price increases have been accompanied by comparatively lower trading volume. This suggests that while the bullish trend is in place, the immediate upward movement may lack strong conviction from buyers, warranting observation for sustained volume to confirm further price appreciation.

## Origintrail
### Trend Analysis
The price of OriginTrail has demonstrated a clear upward trend in the latter part of the provided data. The price has consistently traded above both the 13-period EMA and the 21-period SMA since approximately mid-July 2025. Specifically, on 2025-07-17, the price (0.3796) moved above both the EMA (0.3390) and SMA (0.3271). This bullish alignment continued, culminating in the final data point where the price (0.5004) is significantly higher than the EMA (0.3900) and SMA (0.3520). The EMA has also maintained a position above the SMA, confirming the recent bullish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has shown a significant increase in recent days, moving from the neutral range into overbought territory. On 2025-07-18, the RSI reached 72.64, then 71.05 on 2025-07-19, and after a brief dip to 68.32, it surged to 78.12 on the final data point (2025-07-20). This indicates strong buying momentum and suggests that the asset is currently overbought.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis presents a mixed picture for the recent price movements. While the overall rally from late June to mid-July saw fluctuating volume, the most recent significant price surge from 0.4214 to 0.5004 on the final data point was accompanied by an increase in volume from 1.99M to 3.47M. This suggests some conviction behind the latest upward move. However, this volume is not the highest observed in the dataset, with several earlier periods showing considerably larger volume spikes (e.g., 2024-12-07 at 10.41M, 2025-03-05 at 9.69M), indicating that while the recent move has support, it's not necessarily driven by exceptional volume.

### Outlook
OriginTrail is currently experiencing a strong upward trend, with the price trading significantly above both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and the EMA maintaining a position above the SMA. This bullish trend is supported by strong momentum, as indicated by the RSI entering deeply into overbought territory. While the recent surge in price was accompanied by an increase in volume, the overall volume profile during the broader rally has been mixed. The overbought RSI suggests that while the current upward momentum is strong, there is an increased risk of a price pullback or consolidation in the near term.

## Bittensor
### Trend Analysis
Bittensor was in a prolonged downtrend with the price consistently below both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and the EMA below the SMA. A significant bullish reversal occurred on 2025-07-10, marked by the price crossing above both its 13-period EMA (331.9651) and 21-period SMA (330.4801). Concurrently, a golden cross was observed as the 13-period EMA crossed above the 21-period SMA. Since this crossover, the price has generally remained above both moving averages, and the EMA has stayed above the SMA, indicating a developing uptrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Bittensor was largely in the neutral range, often leaning towards oversold territory in late June and early July. A significant increase in RSI occurred around 2025-07-10, moving it firmly into the neutral zone above 50. It peaked near overbought territory at 69.34 on 2025-07-16, but has since pulled back slightly to 61.01 on 2025-07-19, indicating strong but moderating bullish momentum.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume was relatively subdued during the earlier downtrend. The bullish reversal on 2025-07-10 was strongly confirmed by a significant surge in trading volume (136.2M), which continued to increase with subsequent price rises (165.1M on 2025-07-11, 177.4M on 2025-07-12, and 222.9M on 2025-07-15). However, the most recent price decline on 2025-07-19 was accompanied by a significant volume spike of 261.8M, suggesting increasing selling pressure.

### Outlook
Bittensor recently experienced a significant bullish reversal, marked by a golden cross on 2025-07-10, where the 13-period EMA crossed above the 21-period SMA, and the price moved above both. This shift from a prolonged downtrend to a developing uptrend was initially confirmed by strong trading volume. While momentum, as indicated by the RSI, rose significantly and approached overbought levels, it has recently shown signs of moderation. The most recent price decline on 2025-07-19, accompanied by a notable volume spike, suggests increasing selling pressure that could challenge the nascent uptrend.

## Chutes
### Trend Analysis
Initially, from June 18 to July 14, the price of Chutes consistently traded below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating a prevailing downtrend. During this period, the EMA was also generally below the SMA. A significant bullish crossover, often referred to as a 'golden cross,' occurred around July 15, where the 13-period EMA (54.6479) crossed above the 21-period SMA (53.9512). Following this crossover, the price has consistently traded above both the EMA and SMA, with the EMA now positioned above the SMA. This indicates a clear shift from a downtrend to a nascent uptrend in the latter portion of the data series.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Chutes was in oversold territory (<30) around June 22-23, with readings of 28.72 and 27.78 respectively. Following this, the RSI moved into a neutral range, generally staying below 50, indicating weak momentum. However, from July 10 onwards, the RSI has shown a significant upward trend, rising from 35.98 to reach highs in the mid-60s (e.g., 65.96 on July 18). While it has not entered the overbought territory (>70), this sustained increase indicates strengthening bullish momentum. The most recent readings show a slight pullback in RSI to around 60, but it remains in a strong neutral range.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Chutes showed varied patterns throughout the data. During the earlier downtrend phases, volume generally decreased, suggesting a lack of strong selling conviction. However, a notable volume spike occurred on July 2 (6.0 million) coinciding with a price drop, which confirmed the bearish momentum at that time. More recently, a significant price increase on July 16 (from 60.7055 to 73.573) was accompanied by a substantial surge in volume (7.1 million), which strongly confirms the conviction behind this bullish price action. Subsequent days (July 17-20) show price consolidating or slightly pulling back on comparatively lower volumes (around 2.5-2.7 million), suggesting that the recent upward move was well-supported and the current pause is not indicative of strong selling pressure.

### Outlook
The technical analysis of Chutes reveals a clear shift in market dynamics. The trend has transitioned from bearish to bullish, evidenced by the price moving above its key moving averages and the recent golden cross. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has significantly strengthened from oversold conditions to a robust neutral range, supporting the upward price movement. Furthermore, the recent price surge was confirmed by a substantial increase in trading volume, suggesting strong conviction behind the move. The subsequent consolidation on lower volume indicates a healthy pause rather than a reversal. Overall, the combined signals suggest a developing bullish outlook for Chutes.

## Gradients
### Trend Analysis
Gradients experienced a prolonged downtrend from mid-June to early July, with the price consistently trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has consistently been in the overbought territory (>70) from July 11th to July 15th, 2025, reaching a peak of 77.15 on November 11th, 2024, and 84.46 on November 14th, 2024, and more recently 76.10 on July 15th, 2025. This indicates strong buying momentum and potentially overextended conditions. On July 16th, 2025, the RSI slightly receded to 68.63, moving just below the overbought threshold, suggesting a minor cooling off in momentum but still maintaining a strong bullish bias.

### Volume Analysis
The recent significant price increases, particularly from July 10th to July 15th, 2025, were accompanied by substantial spikes in trading volume (e.g., 56.2 billion on July 11th, 64.1 billion on July 12th, and 68.9 billion on July 15th). This indicates strong conviction behind the bullish price action. However, the most recent data point on July 16th, 2025, shows a price decline on high volume (65.8 billion), which could suggest profit-taking or an increase in selling pressure after the recent rally.

### Outlook
Bitcoin is currently in a strong uptrend, as evidenced by the price consistently trading above its moving averages and the EMA remaining above the SMA. Momentum indicators show the asset has been in overbought territory, reflecting significant buying interest. While recent volume confirmed the upward price movements, the latest high-volume price decline suggests increasing selling pressure or profit-taking. The overall technical outlook remains bullish, but the high RSI and recent volume on a down day warrant close observation for potential short-term consolidation or pullback.

## Ethereum
### Trend Analysis
Ethereum is currently in a clear uptrend. The price has consistently remained above both its 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the latter part of the data. A significant golden cross, where the EMA crossed above the SMA, occurred on 2025-06-11, reinforcing the bullish trend. Since this crossover, the EMA has remained above the SMA, and both moving averages are trending upwards, further confirming the established uptrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI values indicate that Ethereum has been in overbought territory for the past few days, with readings consistently above 70. Specifically, the RSI has risen from 71.53 on 2025-07-14 to 76.54 on 2025-07-16, suggesting strong buying momentum that has pushed the asset into an extended bullish zone.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume has largely confirmed the recent price movements. Notably, significant volume spikes were observed on 2025-07-11 (39.3B), 2025-07-12 (42.4B), and especially on 2025-07-15 (41.3B) and 2025-07-16 (43.4B), coinciding with strong upward price movements. A slight price decrease on 2025-07-13 was accompanied by a notable drop in volume (17.4B), suggesting a lack of strong selling conviction. This pattern of increasing volume on rallies and decreasing volume on minor pullbacks indicates strong buyer conviction and validates the recent price appreciation.

### Outlook
Ethereum is currently exhibiting a strong bullish technical outlook. The price is firmly in an uptrend, supported by both the EMA and SMA, with a recent golden cross reinforcing this positive trend. Momentum indicators show the asset is in overbought territory, which, while indicative of strong buying pressure, could also suggest a potential for consolidation or a pullback in the near term. The significant volume accompanying recent price surges confirms the conviction behind the upward movement. Overall, the technicals point to continued strength, but traders should monitor for signs of momentum exhaustion given the overbought RSI.

## Bnb

The price has continued to climb, maintaining its position well above both moving averages, indicating sustained upward momentum.

### Momentum Analysis

This indicates that the asset has moved into and remained in the overbought territory (>70) during this period, suggesting strong buying pressure and potentially an extended rally.

A significant increase in volume was observed alongside the price surge from July 17th to July 19th, with a notable spike on July 19th (3,421,946,485.40). This substantial volume accompanied the strong upward price action, indicating strong conviction from buyers. On July 20th, while the price continued to rise, the volume decreased from the previous day's peak (1,344,087,816.17), which could suggest a slight moderation in buying intensity, but the overall trend remains supported by previously high volumes.

Overall, the combined indicators point towards continued positive price action for BNB.
