            "BODY": "Long-term crypto investments require more than just hype—they need strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and solid adoption. With the crypto market continuously evolving, the projects that solve real-world issues will be the biggest winners in the coming years. This week, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, and Qubetics stand out as some of the Best Cryptos to invest in right now for long-term, each offering unique solutions and promising growth. While Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano continue to strengthen their ecosystems, Qubetics is disrupting the market with its Decentralized VPN technology, ensuring privacy, security, and efficiency for blockchain users worldwide. With its highly successful crypto presale , Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) – A Game-Changer with Decentralized VPN Innovation Qubetics is redefining internet security and privacy with its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) technology. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a fully decentralized infrastructure, ensuring total anonymity, security, and freedom for users worldwide. With the increasing crackdown on internet privacy, governments and corporations are limiting access to certain content, making decentralized VPNs a critical necessity for users who value their digital freedom. Qubetics enables users to bypass restrictions, protect their online identity, and enhance security using blockchain-powered privacy protocols. Qubetics Presale: High ROI & Explosive Growth Potential Currently in Stage 28, $TICS is priced at $0.1430. Each stage only lasts seven days and includes a 10% price increase, making timing crucial. With the mainnet anticipated in Q2 2025, the current window to enter remains attractive but short-lived. To date, Qubetics has raised over $15.5 million, accumulated 23,900+ token holders, and sold more than 504 million tokens. At the current price, a $2,000 investment yields 13,980 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, the value becomes $13,980. At $5, that grows to $69,900, and at $10, $139,800. The projections aren't hyperbole—they’re grounded in basic returns. It’s this kind of structure and upside that positions Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to invest in 2025. With its powerful real-world applications and explosive growth potential, Qubetics is emerging as one of the Best Cryptos to invest in right now for Long Term . 2. Ethereum (ETH) – The Backbone of DeFi & Smart Contracts Ethereum remains the most dominant blockchain for decentralized applications, with billions locked in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. ETH is expected to see long-term growth with the Ethereum network continuously upgrading, including the recent scalability improvements. The growing Layer-2 ecosystem, institutional adoption, and ongoing innovation keep Ethereum at the forefront of the crypto revolution. With massive staking participation and strong fundamentals, Ethereum is one of the best long-term bets in crypto. 3. Solana (SOL) – The Fastest Blockchain for Web3 & DeFi Solana has emerged as a top Ethereum competitor, boasting blazing-fast transactions and low fees. With its high-performance blockchain, Solana has attracted a massive wave of DeFi, gaming, and NFT projects. Despite past network congestion issues, Solana’s active development and strong community have positioned it as a serious contender for long-term adoption. As Web3 adoption grows, Solana’s scalability and efficiency make it one of the Best Cryptos to invest in right now for Long Term. 4. Cardano (ADA) – A Scalable & Secure Smart Contract Platform Cardano is known for its scientific approach to blockchain development, focusing on scalability, security, and sustainability. With the launch of smart contracts on its network, Cardano is finally competing with Ethereum and Solana. As more DeFi and enterprise projects build on Cardano, its ecosystem is expanding rapidly. With a strong developer community and a long-term vision, Cardano remains a solid crypto for long-term investors. 5. Avalanche (AVAX) – The Ethereum Alternative for DeFi & dApps Avalanche is one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems, offering high-speed transactions and low fees while maintaining strong security. Its Subnet architecture allows developers to launch custom blockchains, making it a highly flexible and scalable alternative to Ethereum. With DeFi and NFT projects migrating to Avalanche, AVAX is gaining strong momentum as one of the Best Cryptos to invest in for Long Term. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Investment Opportunities If you’re searching for the Best Cryptos to Invest in for Long Term , these five projects offer strong fundamentals and massive potential. Ethereum continues to dominate smart contracts, Solana is revolutionizing Web3, Cardano is expanding its ecosystem, and Avalanche is gaining DeFi traction. But Qubetics stands out as a high-growth opportunity, thanks to its Decentralized VPN technology and strong presale performance.

            "BODY": "In a bold move shaking up the crypto sphere, Ripple (XRP) has officially called on the SEC to re-examine its regulatory framework after its recent lawsuit. Ripple’s Letter to the SEC: A Call For Clarity Ripple (XRP) has once again taken center stage by submitting a formal letter to the SEC. The firm insists that the SEC adhere to the existing legal framework instead of imposing new, unclear regulations. In the letter, Ripple argues that creating extra rules has led to unnecessary confusion. As Ripple (XRP) presses for adherence to current laws, the XRP price is finding a renewed balance and displaying bullish momentum . Analysts note that Ripple’s proactive stance could bring more consistency in applying regulations, potentially influencing the XRP price. Ripple’s commitment to legal clarity is seen as a turning point, and many expect the SEC to eventually align its actions with established laws. This call for consistency from Ripple is resonating with market watchers and other cryptos scrutinized by the SEC. The impact of this letter is already visible: the XRP price responds positively as confidence in Ripple grows. With Ripple’s push for clear, existing rules, the SEC is now under renewed pressure to rethink its approach. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Most Electrifying AI Meme Coin While the XRP price gains ground, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI meme token, is grabbing attention and stirring excitement among crypto enthusiasts. This meme token is supported by exceptional features that go well beyond what is typically found in conventional meme coins. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is not just about memes; it channels 1% of every transaction to wildlife protection initiatives. These include sponsoring real hippos by funding sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers, backing habitat restoration projects, and providing conservation technology grants to support wildlife monitoring and anti-poaching efforts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is backed by a secure smart contract validated by blockchain security expert SolidProof. Despite being part of a notoriously volatile segment, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) team is working hard to mitigate the rapid price swings common among meme coins, as shown by the XRP price. Furthermore, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) framework includes a range of mitigation strategies. Planned tokenomics mechanisms, such as staking rewards and a deflationary burn model , are designed to encourage long-term holding. The company also communicates transparently with its community about market trends and regularly conducts third-party security audits of its smart contracts. Additional measures include robust cybersecurity practices, such as multi-signature wallets and bug bounty programs, and ongoing education for community members on wallet and account security practices. Market conditions heavily influence meme coins, and during bear markets, trading activity often slows down, impacting investor sentiment. However, FloppyPepe (FPPE) counters these risks by strengthening partnerships with conservation organizations, adding an extra layer of credibility during market downturns. This would save it from random fluctuations like the XRP price The focus on organic growth through education and community development is key to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) approach, and holding FloppyPepe (FPPE) comes with perks beyond community pride. Token holders receive exclusive airdrops as a token of appreciation, making the ecosystem even more enticing. FloppyPepe (FPPE) introduces exciting features beyond its token dynamics. FloppyX , a smart video bot, generates videos through text interactions and integrates polls, feedback, and sentiment analysis to keep the community engaged. Meanwhile, Meme-o-Matic empowers users to create, share, and monetize high-quality memes without expert design skills. With the presale price set at $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already shown immense early interest. Its private round sold out in just 24 hours and raised $907,200 . Conclusion: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Provides A Wealth-Building Opportunity Ripple’s call for the SEC to follow established laws injects clarity into an otherwise murky regulatory environment as the crypto landscape shifts. Moreover, despite the fluctuations in the XRP price, investors have identified FloppyPepe (FPPE) as a token that will create tremendous wealth for them. An affordable presale price and a sold-out private round have proven to observers that investors are looking to AI coins with real-world benefits instead. In essence, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has proven that the future of crypto is as much about community and real-world impact.

            "SOURCE_ID": 16,
            "BODY": "Opinion by: Genny Ngai and Will Roth of Morrison Cohen LLP Since taking office, the Trump administration has designated several drug and violent cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). US President Donald Trump has also called for the “total elimination” of these cartels and the like. These executive directives are not good developments for the cryptocurrency industry. On their face, these mandates appear focused only on criminal cartels. Make no mistake: These executive actions will cause unforeseen collateral damage to the digital asset community. Crypto actors, including software developers and investors, may very well get caught in the crosshairs of aggressive anti-terrorism prosecutions and follow-on civil lawsuits. Increased threat of criminal anti-terrorism investigations The biggest threat stemming from Trump’s executive order on cartels is the Department of Justice (DOJ). Almost immediately after President Trump called for the designation of cartels as terrorists, the DOJ issued a memo directing federal prosecutors to use “the most serious and broad charges,” including anti-terrorism charges, against cartels and transnational criminal organizations. This is a new and serious development for prosecutors. Now that cartels are designated as terrorist organizations, prosecutors can go beyond the traditional drug and money-laundering statutes and rely on criminal anti-terrorism statutes like 18 U.S.C. § 2339B — the material-support statute — to investigate cartels and anyone who they believe “knowingly provides material support or resources” to the designated cartels. Why should the crypto industry be concerned with these developments? Because “material support or resources” is not just limited to providing physical weapons to terrorists. “Material support or resources” is broadly defined as “any property, tangible or intangible, or service.” Anyone who knowingly provides anything of value to a designated cartel could now conceivably violate § 2339B. Even though cryptocurrency platforms are not financial institutions and never take custody of users’ assets, aggressive prosecutors may take the hardline view that software developers who design crypto platforms — and those who fund these protocols — are providing “material support or resources” to terrorists and launch harmful investigations against them. This is not some abstract possibility. The government has already demonstrated a willingness to take this aggressive position against the crypto industry. For example, the DOJ indicted the developers of the blockchain-based software protocol Tornado Cash on money laundering and sanction charges and accused them of operating a large-scale money laundering operation that laundered at least $1 billion in criminal proceeds for cybercriminals, including a sanctioned North Korean hacking group. Recent: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: Chainalysis Moreover, the government already believes that cartels use cryptocurrency to launder drug proceeds and has brought numerous cases charging individuals for laundering drug proceeds through cryptocurrency on behalf of Mexican and Colombian drug cartels. TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence company that helps detect crypto crime , has even identified how the Sinaloa drug cartel — a recently designated FTO/SDGT — has used cryptocurrency platforms to launder drug proceeds. The digital asset community faces real risks here. Putting aside the reputational damage and costs that come from defending criminal anti-terrorism investigations, violations of § 2339B impose a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years (or life if a death occurred) and monetary penalties. Anti-terrorism statutes also have extraterritorial reach, so crypto companies outside the US are not immune to investigation or prosecution. Civil anti-terrorism lawsuits will escalate The designation of cartels as FTOs/SDGTs will also increase the rate at which crypto companies will be sued under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). Under the ATA, private citizens, or their representatives, can sue terrorists for their injuries, and anyone “who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism.” Aggressive plaintiffs’ counsel have already relied on the ATA to sue cryptocurrency companies in court. After Binance and its founder pled guilty to criminal charges in late 2023, US victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel sued Binance and its founder under the ATA , alleging that the defendants knowingly provided a “mechanism for Hamas and other terrorist groups to raise funds and transact illicit business in support of terrorist activities” and that Binance processed nearly $60 million in crypto transactions for these terrorists. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part. For now, the district court permits the Ranaan plaintiffs to proceed against Binance with their aiding-and-abetting theory. Crypto companies should expect to see more ATA lawsuits now that drug cartels are on the official terrorist list. Vigilance is key Crypto companies may think that Trump’s war against cartels has nothing to do with them. The reality is, however, that the effects of this war will be widespread, and crypto companies may be unwittingly drawn into the crossfire. Now is not the time for the digital asset community to relax internal compliance measures. With anti-terrorism statutes in play, crypto companies must ensure that transactions with all FTOs/SDGTs are identified and blocked, monitor for new terrorist designations, and understand areas of new geographical risks.

            "BODY": "As the crypto market gradually recovers, all eyes are on PEPE Coin, with many experts predicting a price spike. Experts believe that investors can gain up to 3× of their Investmentwithin a month if they buy now. Sounds amazing, right? But did you know that you can make even more profit if you invest in projects in their presale stage, like Panshibi ? Let’s get into the details and contrast PEPE and SHIBI: How PEPE Coins Remains a Powerhouse PEPE Coin is arguably one of the most outstanding meme coins in the market. Admittedly, its price has recently dipped , however, there's signs that it will bounce back soon. PEPE manages to stay at the top by combining meme coin features with real life utility. Once considered just another meme token, PEPE has transcended expectations, finding its way into the pockets of investors. Recent PEPE coin news indicates that the token is likely going to witness a huge breakout within the next month. The metrics used for this prediction evolve around PEPE’s community-driven momentum, as well as speculative interest, which allows it to maintain relevance even as the market gets more competitive. As PEPE still rides the current of investor interest, its peak days seem to be over, as the most it could offer investors is about 3× of their Investment. So what happens if you want more? Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a solid competitor. Still in its presale stage, it offers investors an opportunity to make up to 50× of their Investment. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Next Big Meme Coin to Watch? Panshibi is similar to PEPE in so many ways, for starters it combines momentum associated with meme coins with advanced blockchain functionality. However, SHIBI isn’t your average meme token. The project aims to offer real-world use cases and unique mechanics that could help it stand out from other meme coins. SHIBI implements a burn mechanism to decrease supply over time, giving it potential scarcity and value. Unlike ordinary meme tokens, the project integrates staking, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and DeFi components to provide a more robust ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the roadmap for Panshibi is poised for the long haul. PEPE vs. SHIBI: Which One Should You Choose? Despite their similarities, PEPE and SHIBI also come with distinct advantages that could make them stay relevant and offer investors huge profits. However, if it comes down to choosing one out of the two, it all depends on your risk appetite and strategy. PEPE has a huge fan base, which helps it build speculation and gain value even when the general market is down, while Panshibi (SHIBI) is newer but with huge potential. This means that if you are looking for a relatively more stable crypto, PEPE should be at the top of your list. But if you want huge profits within a short period of time, Panshibi should be your first choice. Should You Buy SHIBI Now? With PEPE coin news suggesting bullish trends for PEPE, the cryptocurrency is still a good option for short-term traders. However, for those searching for a presale opportunity in a meme coin with huge profit margins and long-term potential, Panshibi can prove to be a game-changing investment. With the rising potential of both tokens alongside the changing crypto landscape, there is without a doubt the potential for gains with both tokens, and maybe adding a combination of both in a portfolio could be the safest bet. While PEPE can make you 3x richer, Panshibi can change your life. Keep an eye on SHIBI as the meme coin revolution unfolds. Visit the Website , Telegram, or Twitter to get started.

            "BODY": "GameStop announced plans last week to buy Bitcoin because it is a “very profitable investment,” according to Ari10 CEO. GameStop’s board of directors unanimously approved last week to use both corporate cash and future capital raises to purchase crypto assets, notably Bitcoin ( BTC ). The short-term result? A 22% plunge in GameStop’s share price, its worst day since June. Not off to a good start. Cue the “You Died” screen. A slight bounce on Monday now brings its year-to-date gain to negative 28.64%, although it is still up 82% from a year ago. But beneath the market volatility lies a longer-term strategy that could position GameStop for a turnaround. According to commentary sent to crypto.news from Mateusz Kara, CEO of Ari10, the company’s Bitcoin move should be seen not as a potential turnaround in its core business, rather a calculated bet on a financial reinvention. “GameStop has decided to invest in Bitcoin. Why? It’s simple: the company sees that, in the long term, it is a very profitable investment,” the CEO noted. “An example is how Strategy is making money on Bitcoin.” Certainly the timing for GameStop was not ideal with Bitcoin’s recent price dip. But this does give GameStop favorable entry points, although investors my need some convincing. It’s like buying the Master Sword with one heart left—risky, but potentially game-changin g. Read more: Strive CEO urges GameStop to adopt Bitcoin as treasury asset GameStop needs a new vibe Indeed, there are strategic branding benefits, according to Kara. Investing in Bitcoin is “somewhat fashionable now” and “can improve GameStop’s image.” This is especially true with younger investors who may view the company as a more dynamic, crypto-aligned play and not a brick and mortar retailer whose path into oblivion has been obvious to many for at least 10 years. Basically, they’re trying to evolve from Magikarp to Gyarados (shout out to my daughter for this one!) GameStop’s shares may currently look cheap, but some of that is due to typical “buy the rumor, sell the fact” dynamics. Investors chased the initial Bitcoin speculation but ran away just as fast once the debt-funded plan became official. Trump to the rescue? Uncertainty tied to Donald Trump’s evolving economic policies, particularly tariffs, also continues to weigh on broader market sentiment, a statement Kara doesn’t seem to agree with. “In the long run, U.S. policy may raise Bitcoin’s valuation—which will contribute to GameStop’s share price,” the CEO said. As for whether this move makes GameStop the next MicroStrategy Strategy , that’s far from certain. In terms of legacy stock market-listed companies hoarding Bitcoin, Strategy is the OG and everyone else is copying. It’s like everyone suddenly trying to be the main character in a Final Fantasy game . Unlike Strategy, GameStop is already trading at a hefty premium to its cash holdings. But with a refreshed narrative, retail loyalty, and now a Bitcoin bull case, the original meme stock may still have the ability to charge higher. Or maybe not. Press F to pay respects .

            "BODY": "While bears dominated the crypto market on Monday , large-scale players seemed to surrender. Analytics platform Lookonchain highlighted a key transaction involving the meme token Pepe. Details show a crypto whale offloaded around 438 billion PEPE coins, worth approximately $3.01 million, incurring $434,000 in losses. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow A whale dumped 438B $PEPE ($3.03M) at a loss of $434K in the past hour. intel.arkm.com/explorer/addre… intel.arkm.com/explorer/addre… 4:28 AM · Mar 31, 2025 263 Reply Copy link Read 39 replies The investor’s decision to sell despite staggering losses has sparked debate about Pepe’s short-term trajectory. Has the investor reduced exposure to prevent magnified losses as PEPE heads for further dips? Cryptocurrency whales are entities holding massive amounts of digital assets. They influence market trends with their transactions. Meanwhile, enthusiasts use their movements to predict potential price directions. Meanwhile, whales often dump assets with less profitability and switch to lucrative options. Thus, the immense PEPE dump grabbed analysts’ and investors’ attention. The massive transactions underscore faded confidence by large-scale investors. That indicates a weakness in PEPE’s near-term price performance. Other potential reasons for the significant sell-offs could be portfolio rebalancing or collecting liquidity for a different investment opportunity. Impact on PEPE Massive sell-offs often catalyze panic among retail players, magnifying volatility. The considerable whale dump might exert bearish pressure in the near term. The substantial supply will likely outpace the current demand, especially with the existing broad-based downtrends. Nevertheless, the degree of impact will depend on whether other whales will follow suit. Buy-side interest might absorb the selling momentum to prevent short-term effects. Also, some players could view the dump as an opportunity to buy PEPE, expecting significant rebounds during recoveries. PEPE price outlook Pepe trades at $0.000007007 after a slight 1.25% surge in the past 24 hours. However, PEPE lost over 8% in the past week. Chart by Coinmarketcap The downtrend has likely forced top players to adjust their holdings, explaining the whale sell-offs. A technical analysis hints at more PEPE declines. The frog-themed token plummeted from $0.00000927 – the peak it hit after breaching a descending trendline. PEPE tries to secure the $0.00000698 support (0.50 FIB level). Stability above this foothold could catalyze bounce-backs to $0.00000811, opening the gates to $0.00000927. However, failure to sustain the 0.50 FIB zone could trigger intense sell-offs. Such trends might see PEPE revising $0.00000653 (0.618 FIB) and $0.00000593 (0.786). That would mean an approximately 18% decline from Pepe’s current price. The 1D Moving Average Convergence Divergence reflects waning momentum, indicating an impending bear takeover. The indecisive broad market adds to PEPE’s uncertainty.

            "BODY": "Dogecoin had already suffered a 20% decline over the past month, but Elon Musk’s recent announcement seems to have created even more of a bearish sentiment among investors. In one of his latest statements, Musk mentioned that the government entity he heads, D.O.G.E, shall not integrate the use of Dogecoin into its operations in any way. While this may have been a shock for Dogecoin investors, the demand for Shiba Inu, Pepe, and other meme coins didn’t seem to be affected much, indicating the likelihood of funds from Dogecoin now flowing to other high-potential meme coins. If this indeed is the way the meme coin space plays out, then the project listed below may definitely be worth watching out for. Best Crypto to Buy Now BTC Bull When Dogecoin falters, attention doesn’t vanish—it simply repositions. BTC Bull is a presale that’s been building a narrative ready to intercept that shift. Rather than creating a new meme out of thin air, it pulls directly from the mythos of Bitcoin while anchoring itself to a system of rewards and scarcity. Every growth milestone unlocks fresh airdrops for holders. These aren’t just giveaways—they function as momentum markers, encouraging the community to scale together. A burn protocol runs in the background, gradually cutting supply as demand grows, amplifying pressure for those who wait too long to get in. And the market has responded. With more than $4.29 million raised, BTC Bull has quietly become one of the more heavily supported presales of the season, without relying on flash marketing or artificial hype. In a moment where meme coin capital is likely looking for its next home, BTC Bull offers more than a joke or a trend. It presents structure, pacing, and long-term strategy—three things most meme coins never get around to offering. Catslap Catslap doesn’t try to philosophize meme culture. It leans fully into the ridiculous, which might be exactly what works in a moment like this. With Dogecoin stepping off the main stage, traders are searching for tokens that don’t take themselves too seriously—but still offer room to grow. A cat slapping a celebrity is absurd, visual, and instantly shareable. That’s the pitch, and somehow, it’s working. The token gained early traction through pure virality, but its pull hasn’t faded. What makes it timely now is its current price level. Catslap is trading at a significant discount from its earlier range, meaning entry at this point carries far more upside potential if interest begins to cycle back toward novelty-based meme assets. Crypto YouTuber Austin Hilton claimed that the project had potential for major growth—a sentiment furthered by several other crypto content creators. The team has hinted at gamified extensions that bring the slap meme to life, adding another layer to the project beyond the token alone. While most meme coins burn out after launch, Catslap has kept its rhythm intact by staying culturally active—without overstaying its welcome. With Dogecoin slipping and visual-first tokens getting another round of engagement, Catslap might have just the right mix of simplicity, humor, and timing to thrive in this next phase. Meme Index The fragmentation of meme coin trading is both its charm and its curse. With every shift in sentiment, there’s a new batch of tokens gaining traction, and it’s rarely the same set two weeks in a row. That’s where Meme Index becomes not just relevant—but necessary. This project creates a structured index of the most active meme tokens in real time, adjusting its makeup based on volume, engagement, and token performance. Instead of forcing investors to chase every new coin manually, Meme Index handles that rotation inside one token. In light of Dogecoin’s drop, there’s no shortage of speculation brewing. Traders are watching for which meme coins might absorb that attention. Meme Index doesn’t make that bet—it absorbs whichever coin ends up winning. This approach doesn’t promise the highest gain on a single token, but it dramatically increases the chance of catching the next mover before it peaks. With over $4 million already raised in its presale, it’s clear the community sees value in a model that mirrors the meme market’s chaos without being consumed by it. Meme Index isn’t trying to be the next meme icon. It’s built to catch the ones that come and go—and collect the upside every time they do. MIND of Pepe Meme coins often follow social chatter—but MIND of Pepe is designed to follow it first. Instead of just being a token with an image and a slogan, it’s powered by an AI engine trained to read the mood of the market as it unfolds. It pulls in sentiment data across forums, platforms, and trading communities to figure out where attention is heading before most traders realize it. This isn’t guesswork. The AI isn’t trying to predict value—it’s tracking what people are reacting to in real time. For meme coin holders, that edge can matter a lot, especially when movements are often fueled more by excitement than by charts. Control the Universe. $MIND pic.twitter.com/g9PvY7zpJA — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 31, 2025 MIND of Pepe gives holders access to these trend signals, positioning them with early information before the noise gets too loud. And people have taken notice. Its presale has already pulled in over $7.7 million, suggesting a strong belief in the concept and its ability to serve a purpose beyond just laughs. With Dogecoin’s influence waning and the meme space scrambling for a new axis, MIND of Pepe doesn’t need to become the loudest token in the room. It just needs to stay aware of who is. Solaxy Every market shift pushes people toward movement—whether that’s buying, swapping, or switching chains altogether. Solaxy is built for those moments. While most meme tokens focus on content, Solaxy focuses on motion. It allows users to move assets across Ethereum, Solana, and other supported chains without hitting the typical roadblocks that slow down the process. Its design solves something that isn’t glamorous but is always essential: how to keep up with activity when volume starts to climb. As the market gears up for its next phase, having a way to act quickly across networks becomes less of a bonus and more of a necessity. Solaxy is already backed with confidence—its presale has crossed the $28 million mark, putting it in a rare category of pre-launch projects that are both well-funded and functionally sharp. It also offers staking opportunities for those who prefer to play the longer game. That balance between utility and passive value gives the token some flexibility no matter how fast things move. It isn’t about hype, mascots, or buzzwords. It’s about speed, access, and keeping users from missing out when attention moves faster than the platforms they’re using. And right now, that’s exactly the kind of infrastructure the meme world quietly depends on. Conclusion Dogecoin’s dip may have spooked some holders, but it also opened the door for other projects to prove they’re more than just placeholders. As attention shifts and traders look for the next spark, the tokens covered above each offer something different—some are built to capture humor and culture, others focus on tools and movement. This isn’t just about finding the next meme. It’s about recognizing where sentiment might travel next and being positioned before it gets crowded. For those still watching from the sidelines, these presales could be the entry points worth taking seriously. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

            "BODY": "XRP’s latest price action has traders and analysts watching closely, wondering whether the recent dip to $2.05 marked a short-term bottom. According to Casitrade , XRP has reached the .786 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.05, a historically significant zone for price reversals. What’s more, bullish divergences are now appearing on multiple timeframes, from the 15-minute chart to the 4-hour chart, signaling a potential reversal in the making. Was that the bottom for XRP? After reaching the .786 retrace at $2.05, #XRP is printing bullish divergences from the 15min all the way up to the 4hr chart. That’s the kind of signal we want to see for both short-term bottom and macro! -the bounce is holding so far! … pic.twitter.com/RHQhjx39mO — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) March 31, 2025 Signs of a Potential XRP Bottom Casitrade highlights that XRP is showing key bullish signals , suggesting that the recent decline may have exhausted its selling pressure. The bounce from $2.05 is holding so far, a critical factor in determining whether XRP has indeed found support at this level. The presence of bullish divergences across several timeframes indicates that while prices made lower lows, momentum indicators such as the RSI are trending upward. This divergence often precedes a trend reversal, hinting at a potential rally. Key Levels to Watch While bullish signs are emerging, Casitrade outlines several crucial price levels that traders should monitor: $2.25 Resistance: If XRP breaks above $2.25 with strong momentum, this would be a very bullish signal, as it would invalidate the need for another support retest. $2.00–$2.01 Support: If $2.05 fails to hold, this lower support zone could act as a final defense before any deeper correction. $2.70 and $3.80 Targets: These levels are key resistance zones, aligning with previous price structures and Fibonacci extensions. A breakout above them could signal the start of a larger impulse move. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fib Time Zone 3 and What It Means for April Casitrade also highlights an interesting time-based analysis using Fibonacci time cycles. XRP has now entered Fib Time Zone 3, which projects that April could be a major bullish window for the asset. This aligns with historical market movements, where XRP has seen significant breakouts following retracements to key Fibonacci levels. If history repeats itself, April could be a pivotal month, leading to an explosive upward move. The setup suggests that once XRP reaches its next target levels, a large impulse move could follow. Is the Worst Over for XRP? While market conditions can shift quickly, the data presented by Casitrade suggests that XRP may have found a local bottom. However, confirmation will come if $2.25 is broken with strong volume, signaling that bullish momentum is taking over. With Fib Time Zone 3 aligning with April as a potential breakout window, all eyes will be on XRP’s next moves. If the bullish scenario plays out, XRP could soon be targeting higher resistance levels at $2.70 and $3.80, setting the stage for a larger market rally.

            "BODY": "The changes have the potential to positively impact the state's 39.4 million residents. Assembly Bill 1052, originally introduced on February 20, 2025 as the Money Transfers Act, was significantly amended on March 28 by Banking and Finance Committee Chairman Avelino Valencia. The document now includes a number of provisions protecting the rights of investors in bitcoin and other cryptoassets. The amendments completely change the name of the bill - instead of ”Money Transfers Act,” it is now called ”Digital Assets.” ”California often sets a nationwide legislative vector, and if the Bitcoin Rights Act passes here, it could pass anywhere,” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said on March 30. ”Once passed, this law will guarantee nearly 40 million Californians the right to self-store digital assets without fear of discrimination,” he emphasized. Expanding the legal framework The bill also recognizes the use of digital financial assets as a valid and legitimate form of payment in private transactions and prohibits government agencies from imposing restrictions or taxes on digital assets based solely on their use as a means of payment. The document also expands on the California Political Reform Act of 1974 by prohibiting public officials from issuing, sponsoring or promoting digital assets, securities or commodities. ”A public official shall not engage in any transaction or activity involving digital assets that creates a conflict of interest with his or her public duties,” reads a section of AB 1052. The bill is now officially introduced and awaiting first reading. According to BTC Maps, there are now 99 merchants in California that accept bitcoin payments. Among the largest cryptocurrency companies based in California are Ripple Labs, Solana Labs and Kraken. On February 2, 2025, California also introduced the Stablecoin Bill on February 2, 2025, which seeks to clarify the requirements for stackcoin collateral, liquidation processes, redemption and settlement mechanisms, and security audits. Bitcoin is in the spotlight with U.S. lawmakers According to Bitcoin Law , 95 bitcoin-related bills or measures have already been introduced at the state level in 35 states, including 36 still-active bitcoin reserve bills. The Texas Senate passed a strategic bitcoin reserve bill on March 6 by a vote of 25-5, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the Bitcoin Rights Act into law on March 24. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and Digital Asset Reserve, which will initially use cryptocurrency seized in government criminal cases.",

            "BODY": "Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. announced on Monday their investment in a new Bitcoin mining venture, further expanding the family’s footprint in the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump sons are partnering with Hut 8, a leading Bitcoin mining company, to establish a new firm called American Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining involves operating energy-intensive machines to validate Bitcoin transactions and earn newly minted coins. The industry has seen significant growth in recent years despite concerns over its environmental impact. Donald Trump Jr. emphasized the economic potential of mining over simply holding Bitcoin. “From the start, we’ve backed our conviction in Bitcoin, personally and through our businesses,” Donald Trump, Jr. said in a statement. But simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it on favourable economics opens an even bigger opportunity. Hut 8 to control majority stake Under the terms of the deal, Hut 8 will own 80% of the new company, while the remaining 20% will be held by American Data Centers Inc., an investment entity that includes Eric and Donald Trump Jr. The announcement listed Eric Trump as a co-founder and the chief strategy officer of the new firm. Hut 8 will operate American Bitcoin’s mining facilities across its 11 data centers in the United States. CEO Asher Genoot highlighted the advantages of US-based operations, citing lower energy costs and scalable infrastructure as key factors in maintaining a competitive edge. Despite concerns over Bitcoin mining’s environmental footprint, Eric Trump argued that American miners would outperform global competitors due to the lower energy costs in the US. Trump family’s deepening crypto ties The Bitcoin mining initiative is the Trump family’s third major cryptocurrency venture in the past year. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump and his sons launched World Liberty Financial , a decentralized finance (DeFi) firm offering digital currencies, including a stablecoin unveiled last week. In January, Donald and Melania Trump each introduced their own memecoins , a type of cryptocurrency based on online trends and mascots. These ventures have raised ethical concerns, with government watchdogs warning of potential conflicts of interest. Since taking office, President Trump has eased regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry and proposed the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. Four years ago, Trump was an outspoken critic of Bitcoin, dismissing it as a “scam.” Now, he frequently touts plans to make the US the “ crypto capital of the planet. ” Industry figures join board of directors American Bitcoin’s board will include notable investors such as Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and FabFitFun co-founder Michael Broukhim. Their involvement signals an effort to bring high-profile backers into the project. While the new venture is separate from the Trump Organization, it could eventually collaborate with World Liberty Financial. The company’s priority, however, is ramping up Bitcoin mining operations and amassing a large cryptocurrency reserve. A post on the company’s X account announced that Eric Trump would present his vision and strategy for American Bitcoin in a livestream on Tuesday.

            "BODY": "Australian financial regulators have launched a crackdown on cryptocurrency ATM providers amid concerns about inadequate anti-money laundering controls. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has launched a specialized task force to address potential compliance issues in the growing sector. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas started the internal task force in December. He brought together experts from the agency’s regulatory, enforcement, and intelligence divisions. The group is targeting money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with crypto ATMs. “The task force has been busy engaging with businesses to understand the risks in their sector and assess their compliance with the law,” Thomas said in a statement. Australia’s growing crypto ATM sector Australia has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency ATM rollouts in the Asia Pacific region. The nation has experienced a massive expansion in the sector, with the number of machines increasing from only 23 in 2019 to 60 in 2022. Presently, there are about 1,600 crypto ATMs in operation in Australia. Statistics from Coin ATM Radar indicate a general spread of these machines across prominent cities in Australia. Sydney takes the lead with 451 crypto ATMs, Brisbane comes in second with 267, and Melbourne follows with 200. There are other concentrations of Perth with 157 ATMs and Adelaide with 97. These machines are found in regional areas as well, but with fewer in cities such as Cairns (16), Townsville (13), and Hobart (12). Source: Crypto ATM Radar The overwhelming majority of transactions made using these ATMs are cash deposits to buy Bitcoin. This cash-to-crypto pipeline has raised specific concerns for regulators because it is hard to track the source of physical currency once it’s in the cryptocurrency system. “We want to ensure crypto ATM providers have robust practices to minimize the risk that their machines can be used to launder dirty money or to scam and defraud innocent people,” Thomas explained. The whole network of cryptocurrencies in Australia is more than just ATMs. According to the statistics, 37,996 crypto ATMs are present worldwide, and Australia has approximately 4.2% of the total. Apart from ATMs, the country has 235,495 other cryptocurrency services on various platforms. This huge network is run by 356 operators and 40 producers across 69 countries. AUSTRAC states various crypto ATM issues AUSTRAC’s cryptocurrency task force has identified several areas of concern in the activity of crypto ATMs throughout Australia. Their investigation has uncovered what the agency calls “worrying trends and indicators of suspicious activity.” They are particularly looking for transactions that involve scams and fraud. The regulator is most concerned with making sure that crypto ATM operators perform efficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) screening. Early findings by the task force suggest that some operators may not have adequate controls in place to prevent their machines from being used for criminal activity. The cash-based nature of crypto ATM transactions poses difficulties for regulation. In contrast to normal bank transfers or credit card payments, injections of cash into crypto ATMs are occasionally harder to track and verify. Thomas reiterated the agency’s pledge to deal with these problems on a dual foundation of industry cooperation and enforcement. “We will continue to work with industry to raise standards, but we will also take action against operators who don’t comply,” Thomas said.

            "SOURCE_ID": 69,
            "BODY": "Brazil has officially barred a major category of pension funds from investing in cryptocurrencies, citing risk concerns and the need to preserve long-term financial stability. The country’s top financial policy body, the National Monetary Council (CMN), announced the decision under Resolution 5.202/2025, published last week . The resolution prohibits Entidades Fechadas de Previdência Complementar (EFPCs)—which manage retirement savings for unionized and company-affiliated workers—from allocating any part of their guarantee reserves to digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). The move signals a more conservative shift in Brazil’s approach to crypto-linked retirement planning as other countries begin cautiously experimenting with digital asset exposure in pension portfolios. Crypto ban covers EFPC reserves The Ministry of Finance confirmed in a notice distributed to the Brazilian media that EFPCs are now banned from allocating guarantee reserves to “virtual assets” such as cryptocurrencies. These reserves are set aside to ensure that pension obligations can be met over time and are traditionally invested in less volatile assets like equities, fixed income securities, and government bonds. According to the ministry’s explanation, crypto assets present “specific investment characteristics and associated risk” that make them unsuitable for the long-term, low-risk strategies that EFPCs are expected to follow. The regulation applies only to closed pension entities and not to open pension funds or individual retirement products, which are supervised under different regulatory frameworks. EFPCs in Brazil cater to tens of thousands of workers across public and private sectors. Their guarantee reserves play a critical role in the country’s private retirement ecosystem, and regulators have increasingly scrutinised how these funds are managed amid global macroeconomic volatility and the rise of digital assets. UK and US funds back Bitcoin While Brazil is tightening restrictions, other nations are moving in the opposite direction. In the UK, for example, British pension consultancy Cartwright helped facilitate the country’s first pension-linked Bitcoin investment in 2023. That fund allocated 3% of its assets to BTC, citing diversification benefits and long-term growth potential. In the US, some state-level pension bodies have begun dipping into digital asset markets. Earlier this year, the Wisconsin State Investment Board disclosed a $340 million bitcoin investment via BlackRock’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund, IBIT. Although federal caution remains in place in the US, states are increasingly acting independently to explore crypto-based instruments. In Brazil’s case, the new resolution makes no mention of indirect investment vehicles like ETFs or tokenized platforms. It remains unclear whether closed funds could gain exposure to digital assets via regulated intermediaries in the future, provided such investments are not linked directly to their guarantee reserves. Indirect crypto exposure unclear Resolution 5.202/2025 follows a broader risk-averse regulatory stance in Brazil when it comes to integrating crypto into mainstream financial systems . Though the country has seen the growing adoption of digital assets, especially among retail users and fintech platforms, regulators have pushed back on the use of cryptocurrencies for institutional or critical financial infrastructure purposes. This latest rule builds upon existing guidelines meant to protect retirement savings from volatile and speculative instruments. However, it may raise questions about how Brazilian pension funds can remain competitive in the global landscape, particularly as international peers begin allocating small portions of their portfolios to digital assets. The CMN has not provided a timeline for review or reassessment of the new restrictions, nor has it commented on whether similar policies will extend to other types of financial institutions. For now, the resolution signals a clear line in the sand: Brazil’s closed pension funds will remain on the sidelines of the digital asset economy.

            "BODY": "In a market where attention often gravitates toward hype cycles and meme-driven narratives, some investors are moving differently. Specifically, a number of Ethereum (ETH) whales—wallets holding large quantities of ETH—have begun turning their focus toward a lesser-known but steadily growing DeFi project: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). What’s drawing them in isn’t just the low entry price, but the clear utility, forward-thinking design, and long-term earning potential that stands out in a sea of short-lived plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t just another token launch. It’s being positioned as a foundational tool in the next generation of decentralized finance. Built on a non-custodial model, the platform enables users to lend, borrow, and generate yield—all while keeping full control over their crypto assets. Every transaction flows through audited smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries and creating a system that’s both efficient and transparent. For ETH whales who’ve already experienced growth through price appreciation alone, the interest in MUTM is more strategic. It’s not just about catching a big pump; it’s about entering early into a protocol that offers functionality and real income opportunities. At its core, Mutuum allows users to supply assets and earn interest, or borrow capital by locking in crypto holdings as collateral—without the need to sell. This approach provides flexibility for managing assets in both bullish and bearish market conditions. Another major element gaining attention is Mutuum’s plan to introduce its own overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized alternatives, this stablecoin will be minted directly from assets already deposited within the platform. The benefit? It creates an internal, decentralized loop that strengthens the protocol’s ecosystem while offering a more secure and transparent alternative to existing stablecoins. The stablecoin will be backed by actual on-chain assets and governed through automated smart contracts that adjust supply as borrowing demand rises or falls. Adding to this framework is Mutuum’s mtToken system—a feature that directly rewards liquidity providers. When users deposit crypto into the protocol, they receive mtTokens in return. These tokens track both the principal deposit and the interest it accrues over time. Not only do mtTokens represent the user’s share of the pool, but they also enable passive income, all while remaining compatible with other DeFi protocols and secondary markets. This utility is further enhanced by Mutuum’s buy-and-redistribute mechanism: platform revenue is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to users who commit their mtTokens to designated staking pools. For ETH whales and experienced investors, this built-in buy pressure is a sign of sustainable tokenomics, not just speculative hype. Security and transparency are also being taken seriously by the team. A full smart contract audit by CertiK is already in progress, with plans to announce completion around the time of launch. This assurance of code integrity adds another layer of credibility to the protocol, especially for larger capital holders who need assurance before entering a new ecosystem. What makes all of this more appealing is the timing. MUTM is still in its presale phase, currently priced at just $0.025. That price point alone is attractive for early positioning, but it’s the growing adoption, platform development, and clear utility that’s prompting whales to allocate. Many view it as not just a short-term opportunity, but an investment in a system that will play a critical role in how people borrow, lend, and manage assets across DeFi in the coming years. Mutuum Finance is not competing for attention with buzzwords or marketing gimmicks. It’s quietly building a system that prioritizes real-world use cases, long-term incentives, and security. For those watching the smart money, the trend is clear: when ETH whales start moving toward a project, it’s usually not without reason. And with its fundamentals, roadmap, and utility, MUTM is increasingly being seen as the next big thing in decentralized finance.

            "BODY": "As March ends, the Aptos blockchain holds the fascination of the technology and cryptocurrency worlds—thanks to a series of recent impressive achievements, partnerships, and developments. By expanding its ecosystem through collaborations and proving its technological superiority, Aptos has established itself as a leading player in the blockchain space. A real highlight of the week was the announcement of the test at Aptos and Xangle Official for the new collaborative Ideathon contest. The contest has some meaty incentives, with participants eligible to earn up to $10,000 in prizes. The future is the prize, as Aptos aims to push the adoption and development of its blockchain network through this Ideathon. On top of that, Aptos achieved a substantial mark with the declaration of its rank as the quickest blockchain now in service. Aptos today has a median block time of only 0.13 seconds, which is nothing short of astonishing and makes it not only one of the very top blockchain networks in terms of speed but also really underscores its efficiency and potential for scalability. That is a key factor as the blockchain industry continues to burgeon, and seeing as how scalability has been a major issue that some other networks have failed to overcome. Aptos in the Spotlight: Key Discussions and New Partnerships The week also saw a significant industry conversation when Representative Bryan Steil, together with Aptos Labs CEO Avery Ching, participated in a key talk at Chamber Digital’s Blockchain Conference. The duo held forth on decentralized finance (DeFi) and the freshly unveiled STABLE Act, which sets about creating an actual regulatory framework for not just stablecoins but also other digital assets. As regulators across the globe continue to wonder about the future of digital currencies, Aptos Labs’ involvement in these conversations ensures that the network isn’t just a bit player but rather an essential part of the next chapter in blockchain history.

The preeminent digital asset custody provider has broadened its horizons by embracing the Aptos Digital Asset Standard. This partnership now means that Aptos users can secure their on-chain digital assets using the world-class storage service that BitGo provides. That’s a big deal. If you are going to invest in a network and use it for anything, you need to trust that the actual assets you are minting, sending, or using in any way are trustworthy, as well. Expanding the Ecosystem: Reports and Insights on the Move Programming Language This week, Aptos was not only expanding its ecosystem but was also in the news itself. Messari, the cryptocurrency research and analytics firm, released an in-depth report on Amnis Finance, a platform in the Aptos ecosystem. Amnis Finance, which is characterized by Messari as the “amniotic fluid” for decentralized finance (DeFi), has what seems almost a probable cause to be a candidate for broad adoption in the coming years. Here is why. A key development arose from the insights shared by Alex Nguyen, the CEO of VibrantX Finance, who talked about the origins and evolution of the Move programming language. Move was specifically designed for the Aptos blockchain, enabling safe and efficient smart contracts that fulfill the needs of the Aptos ecosystem. Nguyen’s talk shone a light on the thought process that went into the creation of Move and how its unique design makes it well-suited for the ecosystem it serves. Thanks to the scalability and security features that Move possesses, the language has already gained traction, and those features largely guarantee that applications written using Move will operate in a decentralized environment. Aptos Reaches 70 Million Wallets – A Sign of Growing Adoption One of the most important milestones for Aptos this week was reaching 70 million wallets on the network. This mirrors and magnifies the interest and adoption of the Aptos blockchain by users of all kinds, everywhere. Seventy million wallets is also a powerful indication of both the network’s scalability and its burgeoning user base. The more individuals and businesses that integrate with Aptos, the more it seems like a network that really is rapidly growing and will continue to do so in the months to come. As people continue to adopt wallets at this steady rate, Aptos is bound to see an uptick in interest from an even broader swath of developers, investors, and users. A growing number of individuals exploring our ecosystem means a far greater likelihood of them stumbling across its latent potential. And without a shadow of a doubt, that spectrum of interest includes the Aptos network itself. Looking Ahead: The Future of Aptos Blockchain The fourth week of March was an eventful one for Aptos, with the blockchain demonstrating not just its technological prowess but also its growing heft in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Discussions with regulators about the nascent crypto space were hosted by the Aptos team. Meanwhile, the project notched some impressive adoption milestones, including a foray into the emerging world of decentralized finance. If that didn’t make for a significant week in Aptos’s evolution, the project also formed some new partnerships that could be pivotal in its pathway to becoming a top-three L1 within two years. And the icing on the cake? The project was awarded a coveted spot on the grant list for the Gitcoin Round #17 fundraising effort. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Gunzilla Games’ GUN token — for its Off The Grid game and Avalanche subnet Gunz — is now live. GUN climbed up 12% since its launch early Monday morning, but has since fallen slightly. As of 11:30 am ET Monday, its price was $0.09. The token had a market cap of roughly $60 million at that time, with 604 million GUN in circulation out of a possible 10 billion. GUN already has a trading volume of $126 million just a few hours after launch, per CoinGecko data. The Gunz chain has already seen over 487 million transactions across 14.5 million wallets, according to Avascan data and Gunzilla’s Director of Web3 Theodore Agranat. “Unlike most Web3 projects, we’ve spent five years now building everything first and testing it in testnet for over a year,” Agranat said in an interview with Blockworks, noting that the team chose to launch the token on Binance because it’s the biggest crypto exchange. Agranat says he’s seen crypto exchanges engaging with gaming projects less over the past year — but says those projects that did launch have largely missed the mark. Off The Grid is free to play on PC and console — and doesn’t require a wallet or any crypto. The game is largely a skill-based shooter, though some characters’ “cyberlimbs” grant special abilities. Items can also be bought and used in the game. Those wishing to pour money into the game can pay for Off The Grid’s Pro membership ($12 a month) to use the game’s marketplace, which uses blockchain on the backend. But even if you’re playing for free, you’ll slowly earn GUN as you go. If you’ve already been playing the game, though, those GUN token numbers you’re seeing won’t be turned into actual GUN tokens, Gunzilla has confirmed. “Their main benefits are the rare items that they earned or received with OTG Pro — many of which no one will ever be able to access in the future,” Agranat explained on the benefits for early players in a message. “Hexes” and other items earned early on will transfer over, though. And though it’s challenging, extracting hexes while playing the game will get you more loot (each hex can be decoded to reveal an item). Agranat noted during our interview that over 380,000 hexes had been extracted in just one day last week. I’ve sunk some hours into the game so far, and I like both solo mode and trios mode. This game is fast — more like Call of Duty: Warzone than Apex Legends in terms of time-to-kill and overall speed. But even without its crypto elements, Off The Grid brings something unique to the extraction battle royale shooter genre with its cyberlimbs and gritty, futuristic aesthetic.

            "BODY": "The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) withdrew two pieces of crypto-related staff guidance on Friday, further streamlining its approach to crypto regulation. The first advisory rescinded on Friday was Staff Advisory No. 18-14, Advisory with Respect to Virtual Currency Derivative Product Listings. Originally published in May 2018, the advisory established guidelines for crypto-related derivatives, including requiring reporting firms to maintain “close coordination with [the] CFTC surveillance group” and establishing a large trader reporting threshold of five bitcoins (or the equivalent value for other cryptocurrencies), among other suggestions. On Friday, the CFTC published a letter saying that “additional staff experience” and “increasing market growth” had rendered the guidance unnecessary. The second advisory, Staff Advisory No. 23-07, Review of Risks Associated with Expansion of DCO Clearing of Digital Assets, from May 2023, “emphasize[d] compliance” with CFTC regulations due to the “hieghtened cyber and other operational risks that may be associated with digital assets.” This guidance was withdrawn for another reason — to clearly treat crypto-related derivatives and their issuers fairly, the CFTC suggested. In a separate letter on Friday, the CFTC said it was rescinding Staff Advisory No. 23-07 “to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products.” The CFTC’s sister regulatory agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overhauled its approach to crypto regulation since President Donald Trump took office in January. Under the new leadership of Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force that has spearheaded its transformation, engaging with the industry and backing down from a host of lawsuits and investigations into crypto companies that began under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler. Though the SEC’s rapid transformation may be flashier, the CFTC is currently undergoing a transformation of its own, streamlining its regulatory strategy as part of Acting Chair Caroline Pham’s plan for the agency “get back to the basics.” In addition to the two pieces of dropped crypto-related guidance, the agency has rescinded other non-crypto-related staff advisories and overhauled its enforcement division, slashing a multitude of specialized enforcement teams down to just two, pledging that a simplified enforcement division would be more efficient and “stop regulation by enforcement.” Liz Davis, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and a former chief trial attorney in the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk she sees the two pieces of rescinded crypto guidance as in line with Pham’s “back to basics” approach to running the agency. But Davis also suggested that the changes could be tied to a larger restructuring going on at the CFTC. “They’re probably undergoing a reorganization with everything that's going on with [the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)],” Davis said, adding that Pham’s ongoing efforts to “centralize” the CFTC’s operations could help facilitate a reorganization.",

            "BODY": "When the crypto market takes a nosedive, opportunity often lurks just beneath the surface. Seasoned investors know that downturns can be the perfect time to pick up valuable assets at a discount. This article delves into promising cryptocurrencies poised for a rebound, offering insights for those looking to make wise investments during turbulent times. Injective Price Levels and Market Sentiment Overview The past INJ month saw a steep decline of nearly 37%, while the six-month drop approached 60%. Price action has shown significant downward momentum and heightened selling pressure. Recent performance reflects a period of persistent weakness and volatility, pointing to a bearish run that has resulted in drastic reductions in market value. Current trading levels place Injective in a range of approximately $10 to $18 dollars. The nearest support lies around $6, while resistance is observed near $24, with a second resistance at $33. Momentum indicators are leaning negative, and a brief one-week drop of about 16% indicates that bears remain in control. Traders may consider buying near the support level and look to take profit at or below the resistance levels during this uncertain, range-bound phase. Aave Price Analysis: Recent Performance and Current Price Action Last month AAVE saw a drop of about 20%, reflecting increased volatility amid bearish pressure. In the past six months, Aave managed a modest rebound with approximately a 5% gain, showing mixed momentum. Weekly setbacks of nearly 18% further highlight short-term challenges while hinting at lingering optimism over the longer term. Current prices range between $136 and $290, with immediate resistance around $389 and a second hurdle near $544. Support is near 80. Bearish signals, including a low RSI below 35, show pressure from sellers. Traders may seek buying opportunities near support or consider short-term positions if the price fails to break through resistance. VeChain Price Correction Amid Bearish Signals Last month VeChain showed a sharp decline with prices dropping about 21%, while over the last six months the fall was more moderate at around 2.35%. The data reflects a corrective phase after reaching a broader trading range, with noticeable downward pressure developing during this period. Current prices are trading between $0.019 and $0.043. The nearest resistance is at $0.058, and immediate support appears at $0.010. With a second resistance at $0.082 and a flat lower bound, the market lacks a clear upward trend. Bears hold control with negative momentum and an RSI just below 35, hinting at potential entry points for bulls within the identified levels. Conclusion Investing during market downturns can be strategic. INJ , AAVE , and VET present solid options. These coins have strong potential for recovery. They offer promising opportunities for those looking to capitalize on lower prices. Investing wisely during declines can yield significant returns once the market rebounds.

            "BODY": "Ethereum has once again entered a crucial price range that historically transformed early investors into crypto millionaires. According to Merlijn The Trader , Ethereum is now in the same accumulation zone that fueled massive gains in 2017 and 2020, raising the possibility of another legendary bull run. If history repeats itself, ETH could be on the verge of another meteoric rise. Ethereum’s Historic Accumulation Zones and Breakouts Looking at past market cycles, Ethereum has repeatedly entered consolidation phases before launching into exponential growth. In 2017, ETH traded in a range between $200 and $400 before embarking on an extraordinary rally to $1,400 by early 2018. Similarly, in 2020, Ethereum consolidated between $300 and $600 before skyrocketing to an all-time high of $4,878 in 2021. Merlijn The Trader highlights that Ethereum is once again back in a similar historical accumulation range, sparking speculation that another massive price surge could be imminent. Ethereum is back in the zone that built millionaires in 2017 and 2020. If history repeats, $ETH will make legends once again. pic.twitter.com/je93jvrkZ5 — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) March 30, 2025 Why Ethereum Could Repeat Its Past Performance Several fundamental and market-driven factors support the idea that Ethereum could be on the cusp of another massive rally: Ethereum’s Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Unlike in 2017 and 2020, Ethereum has now fully transitioned to PoS , significantly reducing its energy consumption and making it a more sustainable blockchain. Additionally, staking has locked up millions of ETH, limiting circulating supply and adding bullish pressure to the price. Institutional Adoption and Spot ETF Speculation: Institutional interest in Ethereum has never been higher, with major financial institutions increasingly exploring ETH-based financial products. The approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF has intensified speculation that an Ethereum spot ETF could be next—an event that could trigger huge capital inflows into ETH. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On-Chain Metrics and Supply Dynamics: Ethereum’s burn mechanism, introduced through EIP-1559, has led to a steady reduction in supply, effectively making ETH a deflationary asset under certain market conditions. With increasing demand and decreasing supply, Ethereum could be poised for significant long-term price appreciation. Market Sentiment and Macro Trends: The broader cryptocurrency market is currently in a phase reminiscent of early bull market stages, where assets begin to slowly climb before experiencing parabolic growth. Ethereum’s current positioning aligns with historical market structures that preceded major price surges. Will Ethereum Make New Legends? With Merlijn The Trader pointing out Ethereum’s return to its historical millionaire-making zone, the question remains: Will ETH repeat history and create the next wave of crypto millionaires? While past performance does not guarantee future results, Ethereum’s fundamentals, market positioning, and institutional demand suggest that ETH is gearing up for a potential breakout. If history follows a similar trajectory, Ethereum’s next rally could be one for the record books. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

            "BODY": "Pumpfun is a quickly emerging digital platform that has now reached a giddy height of 1.5 billion dollars in valuation. Its performance—spectacular, to say the least—in the digital finance and cryptocurrency sectors over the years 2024 and 2025 has pushed it to center stage, and surely its investors are popping the champagne. Between January of 2024 and March of 2025, Pumpfun registered a truly unbelievable revenue number: 614 million dollars. From Jan 2024 to March 2025 Pumpfun have made a total reveune of $614M. SecondLane a crypto investment firm invested $15M for 1% stake in Pumpfun Pumfun is now valued at $1.5B pic.twitter.com/WGBbWUnPKu — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 30, 2025 This growth has not gone unnoticed by backers. Of late, the investment firm SecondLane, a crypto-focused venture, has made a move that some are interpreting as evidence of not just ambition but also momentum for the company—investing $15 million to acquire a 1 percent stake in Pumpfun. The firm’s venture arm, which made its name and reputation through early investments in well-known projects like Filecoin, is increasingly backing what it calls “the next wave of the digital economy.” Pumpfun’s Soaring Daily Revenue and Growing Market Position Impressively, one of the best indicators of Pumpfun’s ascendance is what it’s pulling in on a daily basis: $2.11 million. That number places it about where you might expect a shocked cat to be: third in daily revenue in the sector, behind only some bulls who really need a bear to come around. So far, the names Pumpfun beats in the crypto space when it comes to daily revenue are probably the most well-known, including Hyperliquid, Ethereum, and Solana. Pumpfun daily revenue is now the 3rd highest at $2.11M. above Hyperliquid, Ethereum, Solana. pic.twitter.com/emTXDZBdE3 — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) March 30, 2025 This sudden upsurge in revenue demonstrates Pumpfun’s capability to cater to the burgeoning need for its offerings while providing competitive, innovative solutions in today’s rapidly evolving marketplace. With user and investor attention clearly focused on the platform, the company has continued to expand its market presence, offering even greater visibility for prospective, future revenue streams. The business model and approach to digital service that Pumpfun has chosen to implement have obviously worked quite well, winning over not only individual customers but also plenty of institutional investors. From its beginning, Pumpfun has been building its reputation in the highly competitive cryptocurrency and digital finance world. The latest revenue numbers show us two things: Pumpfun is performing strongly, and its strategy is effective. To keep moving in such a competitive space and pull ever greater amounts of market share and revenue speaks volumes and shouts as clear as a bell about the kind of business Pumpfun is. Strategic Investment and Future Prospects The recent strategic partnership with SecondLane has only strengthened Pumpfun’s already solid position. With SecondLane putting in $15 million for a 1% stake, it is clear that the investment firm sees great potential in Pumpfun’s future. This deal is a powerful statement of the confidence that venture capitalists and crypto investors have in the company. It says that Pumpfun is not just a short-term success but a long-term growth prospect. Pumpfun is on track to grow and move deeper into the cryptocurrency space. The world of cryptocurrencies continues to grow and evolve. Pumpfun is strategically positioned to capitalize on developments in this market. With innovative services and a commitment to excellence, the company is primed to play an even larger role in the space of digital currencies. Not only are strategic investments propelling Pumpfun upward, but also Pumpfun’s rejuvenated presence in the marketplace. Its $2.11 million in revenues—earned every day of the week—leapfrog it over well-known adversaries in the digital economy. (Where are you at, Hyperliquid? Ethereum? Solana?) Despite its relative nascency, Pumpfun now rates as a robust and timely player in the elements of the digital economy. The Future of Pumpfun: Growth and Innovation Ahead The future holds a gleaming prospect for Pumpfun. The company, with its present daily revenue level, seems set to navigate well through the digital world, which is always in flux. With the digital world shifting ever more toward not just payment solutions but assets like cryptocurrencies, the news that Pumpfun has an adaptable business model and allots some of its R&D to pure, basic funded research inside the Payment Solutions Div. bodes well for the company. The firm’s capacity to produce such remarkable daily proceeds is a tribute to its well-established base and avant-garde planning. With the continuing upward trend in demand for services pertaining to cryptocurrency, Pumpfun is strategically positioned to reap the rewards of this swell and enhance its standing in the digital finance arena. To sum up, the path of growth for Pumpfun, its remarkable financial achievements, and its latest infusion of capital from investors place it squarely on the path to success in the online and cryptocurrency portfolios. Pumpfun has a $1.5 billion valuation, but even at that, it would seem to be positioning itself as much more than a niche player in digital currency. Call Pumpfun’s innovations and expansion amazing, and you would be right. As far as the world of cryptocurrency is concerned, Pumpfun isn’t either a failure or a flameout. On the contrary, Pumpfun is becoming a continent-sized presence in what is truly an online world by embracing both innovation and expansion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "The current bullish momentum of the Solana price hints at a potential symbiotic relationship with the rapidly emerging Panshibi (SHIBI). While Solana showcases strength, Panshibi 'sinnovative features and impressive presale position it as a formidable player in the crypto market, offering investors a promising avenue for substantial returns and long-term engagement. Does Panshibi Have What It Takes To Dominate The Entire Crypto Market? Crypto investors are always on the lookout for game-changers, and Panshibi fits the bill. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype, this emerging memecoin is rewriting the playbook. As of January 2025, the meme coin market is valued around $115 billion, accounting for about 10% of the entire cryptocurrency market. Panshibi aims to capitalize on this growth with its entire ecosystem that offers real utility, AI-driven Social-Fi rewards, and a rapidly growing community. Investors aren't just getting in on a meme coin for fun; they’re participating in a dynamic ecosystem where users can earn rewards through challenges and community engagement. Additionally, Panshibi’s smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, verifying that it runs as expected without hidden risks. The liquidity pool is locked for 10 years, preventing sudden dumps that can ruin early investments. This setup keeps the market steady and protects long-term investors. The panda-themed project stands out because it taps into Asian markets, where panda symbolism carries cultural significance. Unlike dog-themed coins that feel overdone, Panshibi offers fresh branding that appeals to a global audience. Solana Shows Promise To Resume Bullish Momentum SOL has been on a strong run lately as revealed by the data on Solana price charts. According to this data, SOL is smashing through key resistance levels and picking up serious momentum. The surge comes as the general crypto market is witnessing a rebound and excitement around the SOL ecosystem is growing. A clear sign that investors are piling in on the SOL ecosystem is the fact that daily trading volumes have jumped by 85% to hit $2.56 billion. Additionally, on-chain data shows that the SOL network is expanding fast, with a record-breaking 11.09 million wallets now holding SOL. Technical analysis suggests that SOL has successfully surpassed the upper trendline at $132, signaling the potential for a major Solana price breakout. With this projected breakout, experts are adopting a bullish outlook, with some predicting that SOL could soar as high as $420 in the near future. Conclusion While SOL's growth is impressive, especially given the challenging state of the market, it pales in comparison to the remarkable surge that SHIBI has experienced during its presale. Currently in Stage 4 of a fifteen-stage presale, SHIBI has already raised over $1.28 million. The icing on the cake? You’ll receive a 20% limited-time bonus on every purchase, making this the perfect opportunity to enter at an attractive price of just $0.005.

            "BODY": "Bitcoin (BTC) has gone down by 1.5% in the past 24 hours to stand at $81,927. This would be the fourth consecutive day of losses for the top crypto and its sixth red session in the past seventh. A total of $58 million worth of BTC long positions have been wiped during this period and a similar amount of Ethereum (ETH) has also been flushed out of the system as the price drops near key levels. Analysts see the $80,000 level as a key support area to watch in the near term as these psychological thresholds tend to trigger a spike in buying volumes. If BTC does bounce off the $80K level, this could propel the price of cryptocurrencies like XRP whose correlation with Bitcoin is quite high. XRP (XRP) has one of the highest correlations with BTC at 0.849 according to data from BitInfoCharts . A price correlation of 1 indicates that for every 1% that BTC gains, the dependent asset gains exactly the same percentage. In this case, a 1% increase in BTC price would result in a 0.85% gain for XRP. Bitcoin Could Retest its Nearest Key Support if It Breaks Below $80K From a technical standpoint, bearish momentum has gained traction in the past trading sessions as BTC seems to have rejected a move above a key trend line resistance. Bitcoin’s latest rally appears to be fading, with the daily chart showing a firm rejection at the $89,000 level last week. Technical indicators support a bearish near-term outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has issued a sell signal, and the MACD histogram reflects waning bullish momentum. Adding to this, BTC has also been pushed back from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level—often seen as a last major resistance before trend reversal. If BTC breaks below the $80,000 threshold, downside pressure could intensify, potentially dragging the price to its next support at $76,600. Still, most analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, with expectations of new all-time highs later this year. Indeed, analyst Stockmoney Lizards thinks BTC could bottom out around $80,000 with a rally following soon after for alts. For investors, current weakness may offer a rare opportunity to accumulate before the next breakout. In the meantime, a new meme coin called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is turning heads—offering holders passive BTC rewards as Bitcoin climbs higher. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Captures Investors’ Interest by Introducing an Innovative Rewards Scheme BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the meme coin built for true Bitcoin believers—rewarding holders as BTC climbs to new heights in 2025. Here’s how it works: every time Bitcoin hits a major milestone, $BTCBULL holders benefit. The project features an aggressive supply burn and airdrop strategy, making it one of the most ambitious and rewarding meme coins in the market. Here’s the reward roadmap: BTC $100K – $BTCBULL Launch BTC $125K – Token Burn BTC $150K – BTC Airdrop BTC $175K – Token Burn BTC $200K – BTC Airdrop BTC $225K – Token Burn BTC $250K – Massive $BTCBULL Airdrop As Bitcoin marches toward the $1 million mark, $BTCBULL holders will enjoy milestone-based rewards, reduced token supply, and direct BTC incentives along the way. To buy $BTCBULL, simply head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this meme coin or use a bank card to complete your investment. The post Is $80K Bitcoin the Bottom?

            "SOURCE_ID": 25,
            "BODY": "The market for memecoins is always full of surprises, but few developments have generated as much excitement as Elon Musk’s recent purchase of Vine, which now belongs to his company xAI. Since the Vine acquisition was announced, trading volume and price movement around $VINE, the token connected to the Vine platform, have picked up. There is, of course, a rumor going around that Vine might somehow be relaunched as an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven alternative to TikTok, and that development could have some wild memecoin implications. Since the news was announced, the price of $VINE has shown a significant bullish sentiment, with smart money actively accumulating the token. On March 30 alone, there was a net inflow of over $100K, so the market has clearly reacted positively to the idea of a Vine revival. What many investors and traders now seem to be wondering is whether this will kick off a more sustained trend upward or if it’s just a temporary blip before the market corrects itself. Vine’s Acquisition by xAI: A New Chapter in Social Media? Vine, the app for making short, very short, videos, was very popular. It was so popular that it was a video-sharing platform that, like Instagram, existed very much in the space alongside the then-ubiquitous Facebook and the not-very-missed MySpace. If you wanted to share a video with your friends, it was an option. It was also a thing that comedians did and a space in which performance was what it was about. Should Vine make a comeback in the form of an AI-enhanced platform, it could upend the current short-form video hierarchy, where TikTok rules. The thought of combining Elon Musk’s AI expertise with the preexisting brand of Vine has investors dreaming up new scenarios that lead to considerable capital inflows in $VINE. As with anything these days, from stocks to real estate, there is a search afoot for the next big thing in crypto. The prospect of a relaunch of Vine as a player—and not just any player, but a major one—in the social media field is an enticing proposition. Smart Money Flows Into $VINE: A Positive Signal for the Token Following the first announcement of the takeover, investor sentiment toward the $VINE token has gone through the roof. Inflows of the token have been steady ever since, and I think there might be a good reason for it. Despite the fact that the token had fallen back to about $50 from an all-time high of nearly $200 a few months ago, we had already been primed to expect some kind of crypto bull market coming soon. On March 30, net inflows into $VINE reached more than $100K, showing a clear vote of confidence for the token and the rumored Vine relaunch. What we’re seeing now, and even more so in the last few days, is a repositioning of sorts by investors, ahead of the relaunch and the tokenomics that will accompany it. The most favorable outcome for $VINE is if the smart money—obviously with strong confidence in the direction of the token—gains interest and even further inflates the token’s value during the relaunch. Is $Vine rebounding for Rumoured Vine launch in July? Elon Musk's company, xAI, acquired Vine, sparking discussions about its potential relaunch with AI integration to rival platforms like TikTok. Since the news, we have seen inflows from smart money into $vine Net flow peaked… pic.twitter.com/aqQZmuLHOl — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 31, 2025 Another remarkable deal took place on April 1, when a wallet received an inflow of $86.96K. This particular wallet now possesses 4.3 million $VINE tokens, which are currently worth about $177K. The inflow on April 1 was slightly less than what we saw on March 31, but the fact that we had another inflow on top of what was already a pretty full wallet indicates that $VINE seems to be very much in demand right now. That demand could be pinned on the ongoing rumors surrounding the potential relaunch of $VINE. With that in mind, the fact that capital is flowing into the $VINE token seems to be a pretty clear sign that anyone investing in the token is confident that its value is likely to increase sooner rather than later. Continued Interest Despite Market Volatility Sustained buying pressure surrounding $VINE is one of the most significant aspects of recent activity tied to the token. This is noteworthy because, in the current crypto market, we have seen a lot of volatility, where even the broader market can experience sudden swings. But throughout this tumultuous period, $VINE has continued to see positive net flows and, by extension, a lot of consistent and reliable buying. It is critical to remember, though, that the market is a fickle beast, and the present bullish sentiment could turn around just as easily as it came. In the end, $VINE is quite likely to follow the outcome of the Vine platform as a whole. If the relaunch is a flop or does not hook users, then I expect $VINE might just go back to doing exactly what it has done since a little before Thanksgiving. Nonetheless, the current trend indicates that investors are eager to wager on the chances of Vine making a vigorous return under the auspices of xAI. The prospect of an AI-revamped platform could give Vine a leg up on its rival platforms, affording it an unusual value differentiator in the overstuffed social media space. What’s Next for $VINE? The future of $VINE is directly linked to what happens next with the relaunch of Vine. Should xAI revitalize the platform and its brand by successfully integrating AI into the new Vine, then the potential for significant future gains in $VINE is real. Conversely, if this isn’t the outcome and the relaunch doesn’t meet the high expectations set for it, then we’re likely looking at a sharp correction for $VINE. Currently, we see that there is an overall positive sentiment in the market that could last for some time. This situation is also supported by the fact that smart money seems not to be done yet and is still accumulating the token. Whether this positive momentum will last as more details about the relaunch emerge remains uncertain, but the inflows we are seeing into $VINE suggest that some investors are definitely feeling positive about its prospects. To sum up, the factors driving the price movements of $VINE right now have to do with speculation not only about the relaunch of the Vine platform but also about its ownership under xAI. The current price bull run of $VINE may not just be a bear trap, though, as some might speculate. Even if the coming months see the price of $VINE beginning to truly rebound, the longevity of the relaunch and the Vine platform itself may mean those who invest in $VINE should watch for platform developments closely. If the platform doesn’t succeed, the $VINE price bull run doesn’t matter. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "According to the news in March 2025, experts suggest that Dogecoin price may be tied to U.S. sanctions. Dogecoin, a meme coin once fueled by Elon Musk’s influence, has faced a decrease in volatility due to reduction in hype. Meanwhile, a new token, Panshibi (SHIBI) has sparked interest among investors. Analysts predict a staggering 22,000% surge for SHIBI, fueled by its ongoing presale success which has exceeded $1.28 million. Could this token outshine Dogecoin’s fading glow? Let’s find out How US Policies Are Impacting Dogecoin's Value At its current price of around $0.17 , the Dogecoin price is down 7.21% in the last one month .This price has been on a downtrend, and many experts point to U.S. policies as a major driver. In March 2025, new U.S. sanctions and trade tariffs under the Trump administration have rattled cryptocurrency markets. These policies, aimed at countries like China and Canada, have sparked uncertainty among investors. Dogecoin relies heavily on hype and market sentiment, so when economic fears rise, Dogecoin price dips. News outlets also report that tariffs on imports, set to hit in April, could even slow U.S. economic growth. This makes risky assets like cryptocurrencies less appealing to the public Beyond tariffs, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% has added pressure. High rates make borrowing costlier, leaving less cash for speculative investments like Dogecoin. Analysts say this cautious stance reflects worries about inflation tied to Trump’s policies. This could further affect the crypto market and by extension, Dogecoin price. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has slashed federal spending, saving $115 billion by late March. While Musk’s influence once boosted Dogecoin, this influence has since waned. Now, these cuts signal a tighter US economy which dampens crypto enthusiasm. However, there is still some hope. Trump’s pro-crypto stance during his campaign has fueled talks of more involvement in cryptocurrency. Some experts are even saying there might be a Dogecoin ETF at the end of Q2, with betting odds at 41% on Polymarket . If approved, the ETF could skyrocket Dogecoin price by drawing institutional investors. For now, U.S. policies continue to weigh Dogecoin down while potential crypto-friendly moves offer a lifeline. Can Panshibi Really See a 22,000% Surge? In 2024, meme coins soared, with their market cap jumping over 500% to $115 billion by January 2025. With 2025 tipped as a golden year for altcoins, Panshibi’s bold promises are turning heads. Now, analysts are predicting a huge 22,000% surge for this panda-inspired token. Panshibi blends Asia’s theme, panda charm, and meme coin hype into one exciting project. Currently in stage 4 of its 15-stage presale, the token’s price sits at $0.005 and is set to hit $0.026 upon listing. This would signify a 1,200% jump during presale alone.Also, experts forecast a staggering 22,000% rise after it launches. Compare that to the Dogecoin price of $0.17. In addition, Panshibi offers lots of utilities. Its native token, $SHIBI, offers staking with up to 1,200% APY. Presale buyers will also get a bonus VIP access to the Bamboo Private Club. Since safety is key for Panshibi, its smart contract has been thoroughly audited by Coinsult and passed with flying colors. For liquidity safety, there will be a liquidity lock for 10 years which would set a foundation for an uptrend. With 1.2 billion tokens (60% of supply) available in the presale, everyone can get a share. At the end of the presale, unsold tokens will be burned and this scarcity could drive value sky-high. Conclusion As Dogecoin price wobbles under U.S. policy shifts, Panshibi’s upcoming listings on Uniswap and major exchanges continues to drive a bullish sentiment among investors. There is still time to join the presale train, investors are advised to get a share of the supply before the presale sells out.

            "BODY": "The cryptocurrency landscape knows its fair share of volatility, but some tokens experience a sharper kind of tumble—that is, they suffer a decline that is definitely steep and, in some cases, stunning. $ASKJ is one such token, which was founded by the same team that brought you $ARC. Once its pairing to $ARC ended, however, its price launched a free fall that has sent it down 95.64% since, with no apparent hope of resurrecting itself any time soon. Indeed, the price of $ARC has also dropped sharply—this time by a stunning 92.18%—so right now, the future of $ASKJ seems very much up in the air. A Rapid Decline: The Impact of ARC’s Struggles on $ASKJ $ASKJ’s decline can be largely attributed to its linkage with $ARC. When $ARC started to go down in price, $ASKJ went down with it, and it went down with a dramatic speed and dramatic looks. At one point, it looked like a fountain of money: you put in money, and almost magical, multiplied money came out. Now, it doesn’t look like that, and if you think about why it doesn’t look like that, you arrive at a point where you think about what $ASKJ is, and then you think about what altcoins and memecoins are. At present, $ASKJ’s market price is far low from its starting price; the opening price for $ASKJ was $125. The price is currently $22, reflecting a 82.4% drop. Since the continual declining of $ARC, the performance of $ASKJ is under a lot of pressure, and prices are dipping. Additionally, $ASKJ’s price is tied to the performance of $ARC in the market. In other words, $ASKJ is facing a lot of consistent selling pressure. Thus, $ASKJ is under both a lot of pressure and a downward spiral in the market. Wallet Insights and Buyer Sentiment: A Lack of Confidence Recent on-chain data from Stalkchain token insiders has given even more recent and greater insight into the current state of $ASKJ. The analysis has revealed something that is quite worrisome: the overwhelming majority of the top 90 wallets holding $ASKJ are currently in the red. This means that what was once an investment is now an unrealized loss for these holders, and there is no immediate sign of a recovery. The largest wallet has an unrealized profit-and-loss (PnL) of -$219.95K, and the current value of what is held has dwindled to just $7.54K. Overall, this situation does not inspire any confidence. The market is also notably short of new buyers. Daily inflows of small amounts do occur, but they are not substantially different from what was happening before and are not sufficient to get the price moving in a meaningful way. From this, we could infer that the sentiment is weak—not just in terms of the buyers we do have, but also in terms of the kinds of buyers that are entering or being seen in the market. Because most of the leading wallets are holding $ASKJ at a loss and no new investment is coming into the token, the price looks to be caught in a death spiral. The absence of buying interest puts more weight on the token and seems to make a recovery even less likely. What Does the Future Hold for $ASKJ? Given the existing conditions, the future of $ASKJ looks bleak. The absence of fresh buyers, combined with the already substantial losses seen by major holders, puts the token in a delicate spot. Barring some sort of miraculous upswing in market sentiment or a recovery in $ARC’s price, $ASKJ looks poised to keep heading down. 1. No Fresh Capital in a Weak State: As stated, the lack of new buyers and the reality that almost all big holders are in the red suggest that $ASKJ is in a pretty weak state. The absence of fresh capital to offset the selling pressure is a pretty big concern for the token’s ability to regain some life. 2. Continued Pressure to Sell: In the absence of flowing forces or clear evidence that positive sentiment is resurfacing for $ASKJ, the token is likely to endure continued pressure to sell. In fact, it could take only a small number of large orders to sell the token for $ASKJ to see another sharp drop in its apparent value. And if the current trend of selling $ASKJ continues, it could look forward to almost daily value losses; the current upturn in the crypto-universal market looks insufficient to provide the necessary buoyancy. But what happend to $ASKJ founded by $ARC Team AskJ is founded by the team of @arcdotfun and it is paired to $ARC but this token have dropped in price by -95.64% since launch. Since ASKJ is paired to ARC it means that its price is dependent on ARC’s performance which has also… pic.twitter.com/RXuZtBRVSS — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 31, 2025 Conclusion: A Token in Trouble $ASKJ serves as a reminder of the risks associated with tokens heavily dependent on the performance of a single asset. Initially, pairing with $ARC seemed like a good idea; however, with $ARC now in freefall, $ASKJ also looks like it’s sinking fast. $ASKJ struggles with a tepid reception from investors, relentless sell pressure, and a downright anemic appearance on the capital formation front. $ASKJ is in a pallid state. It is not likely to trade very much until such time as its underlying market conditions change significantly. If you are holding $ASKJ, be prepared for the possibility of incurring further losses.

            "BODY": "An analyst has pointed out how XRP and three other altcoins look like they share a similar technical analysis (TA) fate. Here’s what could be in store for these assets. TA Patterns Are Pointing At Same Outcome For Four Altcoins In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out a commonality that may be present among XRP (XRP), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and yearn.finance (YFI). Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead The similarity lies in the signal that TA is giving on the price charts of each of these altcoins. Here are the graphs the analyst shared, showing the patterns: The first chart (top left) highlights the trend in the 1-day price of XRP, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. It would appear that the asset has possibly been forming what’s known as a head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern forms when an asset’s price shows three peaks following a sharp surge, with the inner and outer peaks being similar in scale (the shoulders), and the middle one the largest (the head). The formation also involves one other feature: a support trendline that facilitates the formation of the different peaks. From the graph, it’s apparent that XRP is currently retesting this support line, after forming its third peak (the right shoulder). The head-and-shoulders generally signal a reversal of trend, so it’s possible that the coin may end up failing this retest and a sharp plunge would follow next. Bitcoin Cash, the bottom right chart, is also making a retest of what could be an important support line. In this case, the trendline is the lower one of a symmetrical triangle. The symmetrical triangle occurs when an asset finds itself consolidating between two trendlines that converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the channel, the distance between its tops and bottoms progressively becomes narrower. The upper channel provides resistance and the lower one provides support, but as the consolidation gets very narrow (that is, the price approaches the apex of the triangle), a breakout can become likely. Recently, Bitcoin Cash has come quite close to the triangle’s end, so it’s possible that an escape may be happening soon. As BCH is retesting the lower trendline right now, it’s possible that this break could happen towards the downside. Such a breakout, if one happens, could be a bearish signal for the coin, just like the one for XRP. Related Reading: Could XRP Actually Reach $10,000? Expert Weighs In The other two altcoins, Ethereum Classic (top right) and yearn.finance (bottom left), are both near the bottom line of a parallel channel. In this pattern, consolidation occurs between two parallel trendlines. It’s possible that support might end up holding for these coins, just like it has in the past, but given the fact that they have been trading inside the channel for a couple of years now and that a shift toward a bearish mood has taken place in the sector, a breakout to the downside may be coming. It now remains to be seen if XRP and the other altcoins will end up following in the trajectory that TA has been hinting at or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.06, down over 16% in the last seven days. Featured image from Dall-E, charts from TradingView.com",

            "SOURCE_ID": 43,
            "BODY": "A predictive algorithm by Grok 3 AI has turned its spotlight on three altcoins — Solana (SOL), Pepe (PEPE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — that have the potential to copy Ripple’s historic rally in 2017. Adding to the speculation, the analysis estimates a phenomenal 15,100% return on a $500 investment — inflating portfolios to $55,000. Whereas Solana rides a wave of institutional bullishness and Pepe reaps the benefits of meme-led price volatility, the presale momentum of Mutuum Finance is drawing comparisons to its early-stage counterpart, XRP, combining the benefits of DeFi industry utility and aggressive tokenomics. Solana (SOL): 96% Rally Prediction BlackRock has also been the cornerstone of Solana’s blockchain infrastructure as institutional interest continues to grow. According to on-chain analysis platform Santiment, social sentiment metrics show an all-time-high 18:1 bullish-to-bearish ratio, indicating traders’ bullishness towards SOL’s reversal. Shifting at $139, the token price has gained 7% in a week despite slight corrections. Analysts emphasize a significant demand zone, foreseeing a 96% jump to $270 should SOL break above $180. In what is adding fuel to the rally, Solana-based Ghiblification meme coin has within 24 hours exploded up 2,600% — reminiscent of January TRUMP-fuelled FOMO. With PumpFun Volumes doubling, SOL’s ecosystem is set for parabolic growth, using meme coin mania to onboard retail liquidity. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Mania Fuels Speculative Projections Pepe’s price trajectory is still linked to meme coin mania and has risen 11% this week to $0.000008. Analysts spot $0.000007 as a potential support floor, with resistance at around $0.000008. Some experts predict $0.00005 by October 2025 and $0.000011 in April according to short-term forecasts and a speculative 2025 model prediction from TradingView. Changelly predicts the $0.000035 target if the positive market sentiment persists. PEPE’s retail hype dependence makes it fragile despite a 106% monthly increase. Its value, rather, is dependent on social media virality and exchange listings — a double-edged sword in the mercurial world of crypto. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is establishing itself in crypto lending by delivering compelling real-world utility while being backed up by structured tokenomics. Now in Phase 4 of its presale, $MUTM tokens are priced at $0.025, raising more than $5.8 million and acquiring over 7,500 holders. Investors buying in now have a solid 20% gain waiting for them, before Phase 5 takes it to $0.03. Tokenomics cement MUTM’s attraction: a $0.06 listing price ensures early birds a starting 140% profit upon launch. After the token is on its way, projections have revealed the upside and analysts expect the MUTM to rise to $1.50 by the year 2025, making it a 5,900% increase from where it sits today. This is a bright outlook due to MUTM buy-and-distribute model which drives platform revenue into token buybacks will keep demand high whilst rewarding stakers. Security is at the top, with Certik auditing Mutuum’s smart contracts, near completion. When completed, the audit results will be systematized through social channels to build investor confidence. Timing and Pricing for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 is quickly nearing capacity as traders bet on the next price spike, similarly to how XRP’s 2017 ICO phase filled in the blink of an eye. As one of the 11 planned stages of the launch, participation now means the highest return on investment potential before the exchanges listing bring even greater the visibility. Mutuum lending infrastructure with mtTokens and overcollateralized loans threatens to make the protocol more of a DeFi staple than a meme that quickly fades. Grok 3 AI’s algorithmic prediction is consistent with trends in the market seen during XRP’s legendary run. While Solana and Pepe present high-risk opportunities for outsized gains, the presale strategy of Mutuum Finance — supported by audits, utility and buy pressure — provides a measured entry point into the next evolution of DeFi. And with the crypto market gearing up for a bull stage, time is running out for Phase 4 of MUTM. Once the project moves to the next stage, you could miss out on a 20% gain and far higher returns. Get your MUTM tokens now before Phase 5 sets off another price spike.

            "BODY": "Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E gained high-level access to a major federal payroll system over the weekend, giving it visibility into the personal and financial data of about 276,000 government workers. Two anonymous sources told The New York Times that the DOGE team obtained administrative access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS) on Saturday. This system is housed at the Interior Department and processes salary payments for employees in agencies such as the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, and the Department of Homeland Security. The system also covers the Air Force, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Senior IT officials at the Interior Department initially opposed DOGE’s request, arguing that the information, containing Social Security numbers and other sensitive details, is supposed to have stronger safeguards. The two anonymous sources said those objections about sensitive info were overridden, and at least two IT officials who resisted DOGE’s request were placed on administrative leave and are now under investigation. DOGE has pushed for access to federal databases in recent weeks. In some instances, these efforts have faced legal challenges. But Saturday’s development appears to be the most significant so far since it involves a system that processes tens of thousands of federal paychecks. A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Kathryn Martin, said in a statement on Sunday, “We are working to execute the President’s directive to cut costs and make the government more efficient for the American people and have taken actions to implement President Trump’s Executive Orders.” Musk has been defending his actions Mr. Musk, speaking on Fox News last week, defended his team’s drive to access government personnel data. He said DOGE’s main goal was to reconcile separate databases in an effort to reduce waste and fraud. “These databases don’t talk to each other,” he said. “That’s really the biggest vulnerability for fraud. We need to reconcile the databases. It’s a, frankly, painful homework, but it has to be done, and will greatly improve the efficiency of the government systems.” Elon Musk and the DOGE team discussed their actions on Fox News. Source: Fox News At the Interior Department, the two individuals said DOGE staff members Stephanie Holmes and Katrine Trampe had been seeking elevated administrative access to the payroll system for about two weeks. That access would allow them to hire or fire employees, change salary levels, and adjust health benefits with limited or no further approval. Senior career employees at the Interior Department circulated a memo late last week outlining the risks. The memo noted that “no single DoI official presently has access to all HR, payroll and credentialing systems,” indicating the rare nature of DOGE’s request. It further warned that the Privacy Act imposes possible criminal penalties if sensitive personal information is viewed. Another concern is that granting extensive credentials to individuals who have not undergone specialized training could result in “significant failure” from operator error, as described in the memo. Despite these warnings, the two people said DOGE leaders pressed forward. Federal employees attempted to have Interior Secretary Doug Burgum review and sign the memo. The two sources mentioned that Burgum didn’t sign the memo. Instead, Tyler Hassan, who once served at DOGE and now works at the Interior Department, put the agency’s chief information officer and chief information security officer on administrative leave. The two employees are also under investigation for their supposed “workplace behavior.” With those officials sidelined, Ms. Holmes and Ms. Trampe were granted the administrative credentials they had been pursuing. By Saturday, DOGE had effectively gained visibility into and control over the employment status, compensation, and benefits of about 276,000 federal workers at dozens of agencies. These developments have caused anxiety among longtime government employees, particularly those worried about data privacy and potential political retaliation in the hiring and firing process.

            "BODY": "The memecoin market welcomed a capital influx on March 30, 2025, as wise fund managers steered money within the nascent ecosystem. On-chain data outlined a picture in sharp contrast to previous weeks, showing that inflows into memecoin assets had handily beaten any other type of outflow. With funds flowing in, the day’s net volume into memecoins hit $1.26 million, against a $2.70 million volume that was traded in total. That trading volume may have been exaggerated by some involved trying to give their positions a plausible air of legitimacy, but it was nonetheless a hallmark of a day of activity and prominence for cryptocurrencies tied to internet memes. The current flurry of activity isn’t a fluke; it is based on real events. Some of these trading opportunities have arisen from the recent market resurgence. Others are simply a function of the kind of behavior that typically defines and drives the memecoin market. This is a sector of the crypto market where an increasing number of participants drive prices up, after which an increasing number of participants take over and drive prices down. This is all fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) and the predictable crypto Twitter rallies. Memecoin Inflows Dominate the Day The substantial inflow that outpaced outflows by nearly three times was the most notable aspect of the March 30 activity. The total inflow for the day was reported at $1.98 million, compared to $721,000 in outflows. The positive net flow of $1.26 million indicates a level of confidence and interest from investors, demonstrating that even with the typical volatility of the memecoin market, investors still take the time to show their net positive support. A number of memecoins have seen big inflows lately, with $GOAT, $FARTCOIN, and $GRASS standing out as the biggest gainers. $GOAT, for example, had a big inflow of $236,000 this past week, and it looks like investors’ interest has been piqued. Meanwhile, $FARTCOIN saw an impressive inflow of $547,000. Both of these moves signal that investors are becoming increasingly apeshit over specific memecoins, wagering that some of them will moon in the not-too-distant future. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 30/03/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $1.98M Outflow: $721K Volume: $2.70M Net Volume: $1.26M There was inflow into: $VINE ($97K) $GRASS ($151K) $GOAT ($236K) #FARTCOIN ($547K) $WIF … pic.twitter.com/pfQ3MLWH25 — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 31, 2025 At the same time, $GRASS brought in an influx of $151,000, while $VINE drew in $97,000. These figures that I just recited are not very large relative to the rest of the market, and they are not very large on an absolute basis even if I just looked at them. %FILLER% But the fact that investors are putting even this much into these memecoins is a sign of something. These memecoins are also attracting more and more investment, which speaks to the diversification trend within the memecoin sector. $DOGE and $SHIB may still be the big dogs in terms of memecoin market cap, but there are now a whole bunch of memecoins with much smaller market caps that investors are looking at. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at the list of some of the memecoins with small market caps that people are supposedly investing in. Outflows Reflect Market Caution Although inflows predominated, there were also significant outflows from certain memecoins, denoting a shift in investor sentiment in specific market sectors. The largest outflow occurred with $TRUMP, from which $59,000 exited the asset’s market. Following that, $STONKS saw $46,000 flow out of its market, and $JTO had a $54,000 outflow that reduced its market cap. $GHIBLI also had an outflow of $30,000, and $ALCH was notched up with a $55,000 outflow. The outflows from these memecoins may imply a reevaluation of their market potential. Investors in these assets could be redirecting their attention to newer or more fecund tokens, like the ones receiving inflows on March 30. This trend underscores the fierce competition within the memecoin market, where the perception of potential can change in a heartbeat and where the newest projects always seem to have a shot at taking over for the ones that have lost their luster. It is important to note that outflows don’t necessarily indicate a long-term bearish sentiment toward these assets. Many memecoin investors tend to engage in short-term, speculative trading, moving their capital around rapidly in response to changing market conditions, news, or sentiment shifts. The outflows could simply represent temporary rebalancing or profit-taking by investors who want a more diversified portfolio. For them, that might mean shuffling memecoin capital out of memecoins and back into previously held assets, which could be anything from stocks to stablecoins. The Growing Popularity of Memecoins On March 30, the activity reflects a larger trend in the cryptocurrency market—the emergence of memecoins as a distinct asset class, drawing both retail and institutional attention. Once seen as the joke of the crypto space, memecoins have become legitimate trading vehicles for a wide array of market participants. Their high speculative appeal and viral nature make them short-term trading opportunities as well as investments driven by the kind of community hype that used to fuel the pump-and-dump schemes of yore. As memecoins gain popularity, they are more and more viewed as a gauge of market sentiment and a vehicle for traders to play the meme-driven trend. This makes sense. Memecoins are, by definition, thematic. They go up not because they have some fundamental underlying value but because people are buying them and, yes, trading them in and out at the right moment. And when we talk about right moments in trading, we’re often talking about timeframes that are all too susceptible to being influenced by the kinds of things that stir up online communities. Memecoins generate much interest and are also a good example of how social media and internet culture are apparently now central to the formation and growth of the cryptocurrency market. They are, in a way, a direct result of the psychology and sociology of the new virtual economies we are now part of. Platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord have become the epicenters of that virtual economy. Conclusion: A Volatile but Exciting Market The market for memecoins remained volatile and dynamic in March 2025. Inflows of $1.98 million were far larger than outflows of just $721,000, on the 30th of that month. That day, investors put significantly more money into memecoins than they withdrew, which implies that the more thoughtful, or “smart,” investors stomach the risks of the memecoin market and still see it as a place where they can make worthwhile token investments. Memecoins might be the last place you’d expect a thoughtful investment strategy, but such coins as $GOAT, $FARTCOIN, and $GRASS show that some folks are allocating a portion of their assets to that market. Nevertheless, specific memecoins are experiencing outflows that hint at some potential caution in the market. He’s too fond of us to let anything too awful happen. Investors are always reassessing. We’ve got both experienced traders and total newbies hitting up our space, searching for the next next big thing. The memecoin sector remains an exciting and totally wild part of the market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "Cardano received a significant boost earlier in the year when it was listed as one of the crypto projects to constitute the new strategic US crypto reserve , as announced by President Donald Trump. Since then, a lot has happened with the ADA Price movement. Market analysts are now weighing up the crypto project’s chances against other promising prospects like the new high-flying Panshibi ($SHIBI) as its presale continues to attract attention and sell out fast. As investors search for the best crypto to buy for huge gains this year, what does Cardano’s price prediction and recent price action since the reserve announcement suggest? Or is Panshibi the best crypto to buy for exponential growth this year? Latest Cardano News Reveal ADA’s Price Struggles Since Reserve Announcements, Investors Seek Better High-Growth Alternatives Cardano is going through a rough patch as trading volume falls amid the market downturn . While Cardano has enjoyed a strong position, coupled with its presence on the list of cryptos in the US strategic reserve, its recent dip emphasizes the risks of crypto projects. Many ADA investors now seek emerging projects like Panshibi, which presents a more straightforward growth path. According to market charts, Cardano's price has dropped nearly 25% in the past 30 days, forcing many token holders to consider alternatives with higher profit prospects. Thanks to Cardano’s loyal and supportive community, the crypto has held a strong position for a long time. However, due to Cardano’s slower upgrade process , the altcoin project lags behind top competitors like Solana. Experts believe this wait could negatively impact its long-term competitiveness. Cardano is currently going through a price correction that has lasted over a week. Hence, investors lean toward new projects that blend innovation with rapid expansion. This consideration is why tokens like Panshibi are top of their lists. Here's a crypto project whose presale is gaining traction as it bridges traditional and crypto markets, setting itself up to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Panshibi’s Explosive Presale Momentum Sets It Up for UnrivaledROI Delivery Panshibi presents investors with a shot at massive returns and an opportunity to be part of something fresh and promising. Its presale has delivered consistent gains as the project sets up to deliver skyrocketing gains once it launches on major exchanges. This new crypto project combines an Asian theme with a love for pandas and their conservation, making it more than a regular memecoin project. Thanks to its distinctive approach, Panshibi consistently establishes itself as a top-trending token this year and the best crypto to buy. Beyond its memetic appeals, Panshibi adds real utility with Social-Fi and AI-driven opportunities for users to earn rewards. $SHIBI token holders can participate in community activities and stake their tokens for up to 1,200% APY. As holders, you also enjoy access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. More value for early investors. Analysts have identified that Panshibi’s roadmap guarantees fair distribution throughout its presale. This presale has a $10 million cap and will run for 60 days. Time is running out as Stage 4 is selling out fast. Considering the token price grows with each completed phase, there's an opportunity for massive gains here. Early adopters are better positioned for significant ROI before prices surge further. Post-launch, analysts foresee a skyrocketing 145,000% price surge ahead. With security being a priority, Coinsuit has fully audited Panshibi’s smart contract. Such commitment to project security also means the token ownership will be renounced after the presale. Here's a setup to drive trust and move toward a potential 20,000% ROI for early investors. To participate in the Panshibi presale, check out their Telegram , Twitter , and Website .

            "BODY": "In a dramatic shift within the cryptocurrency market, the ratio of ETH to BTC has dropped to a five-year low of 0.02193, signaling a significant underperformance by Ether in relation to Bitcoin. This drop represents a 39% decrease in Ether’s value compared to Bitcoin over the course of 2025—a year that, until this point, many had thought would be a bull market for Ethereum. This is the first time in the 12 months following a Bitcoin reward halving that Ether has not managed to outperform Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin halving events have been associated with significant price increases for both assets, yet this time, Ethereum has lagged behind. The ETH/BTC ratio dropped to a five-year low of 0.02193. Ether has fallen 39% relative to bitcoin this year. It's the first time ETH has underperformed BTC in the 12 months after a bitcoin reward halving. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 31, 2025 Ethereum’s Struggles: A Five-Year Low The plunge in the ETH/BTC ratio is remarkable since it registers the lowest point in five years, a depth not reached since Q3 2019. At that time, the ratio had plummeted to 0.0164, with Ether undergoing a quarterly drop of 46% compared to Bitcoin. And while we have moved on from that period, this latest nosedive in the ratio clearly signals that the market favors Bitcoin over Ether, which now seems to be lagging. This year’s Ethereum underperformance is significant for a variety of reasons. Ether’s price has seemed principally directed, in terms of investor attention, toward Bitcoin. This happened in the wake of a halving event, when the reward for mining Bitcoin was reduced by half. Before we understood the potential of Ethereum, people thought of it as a digital asset, and its token was based on the types of things Bitcoin was capable of doing. Ether’s fall against Bitcoin underscores the latter’s growing dominance as the dominant cryptocurrency, especially following the recent halving. Over the years, Ethereum has asserted itself in folks’ minds as a close competitor to Bitcoin—but when you look at what happened to both these cryptos after both went through major halving events, it seems that Ethereum isn’t always on the same growth trajectory as Bitcoin. The decline in the ETH/BTC ratio signifies that more and more folks seem to be investing in Bitcoin instead of either Ethereum or its dark horse cousin. Bitcoin’s Inflows Continue Amidst Outflows from Short-Bitcoin Products Despite the fact that Ethereum is under pressure, Bitcoin still enjoys a steady stream of investment. Just last week, Bitcoin registered inflows of $195 million, which only emphasizes the fact that it’s still a highly desired and sought-after asset among investors. By comparison, short-bitcoin investment products have seen outflows for four weeks running, with the last week totaling $2.5 million. This juxtaposition reflects a much broader and developing shift in investor sentiment. More market participants than ever appear to be bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bitcoin saw inflows totalling US$195m last week, while short-bitcoin investment products saw outflows for a 4th consecutive week totalling US$2.5m. Recent price falls have pushed bitcoin global ETP’s total assets under management to their lowest level since just after the US… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 31, 2025 The Bitcoin inflows are impressive and suggest that both retail and institutional investors have confidence in the asset. This is especially the case in light of the most recent halving event. The halving, which happened in April 2025, generally indicates a tighter supply and a potential future surge in the value of Bitcoin, making it an appealing investment right now. Its status as a store of value and a hedging mechanism against inflation remains robust, with such global conditions enabling and perhaps even enhancing its attractiveness. The reverse trend is developing, however, for short-bitcoin products, which have now experienced four consecutive weeks of outflows. This trend might indicate a growing faith in Bitcoin’s resilience and a move away from bets that hinge on Bitcoin’s decline. Investors who once sought to profit from what they thought was an inevitable decline in Bitcoin’s price might now be rethinking their strategies, especially as the cryptocurrency continues to show signs of a recovery after the recent halving. Bitcoin’s Assets Under Management Fall to Lowest Level Since U.S. Election Though a lot of money has come in, the total amount of capital now inside global ETPs (exchange-traded products) tied to Bitcoin has dropped. These days, Bitcoin has just $114 billion in total AUM (assets under management), which is the lowest that number has been since pretty much right after the elections in the U.S. The price of Bitcoin has, of course, fallen since then, and the price has definitely not been stable in the time since. With ETPs obviously linked to the price of the underlying asset, this lack of stability (and the total drop in price) has led to a drop in total AUM for Bitcoin globally. The drop in AUM for Bitcoin ETPs could also be due to investors being hesitant to commit a significant portion of their portfolios given the current regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto space. While the most recent inflows into Bitcoin ETPs show that there are still institutional investors out there willing to trust in the long-term safety and value of a Bitcoin-like instrument, the reduced AUM also signals that a fair number of investors seem to prefer a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. Despite the market’s volatility, Bitcoin largely remains the unchallenged number one in the cryptocurrency world. As a once-in-a-lifetime financial innovation, Bitcoin continues to be not only the largest digital asset but also the most recognized. For many, it remains the very foundation of the still-nascent cryptocurrency market. Yet Bitcoin’s assets under management, or AUM, have decreased, indicating that the level of investor interest in the digital financial tool is also decreasing. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum and Bitcoin? Ether and Bitcoin perform differently, which leads to unavoidable questions about the future of both cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin stays on top, keeping the momentum it had when it was halved. In contrast, the Ethereum network underperforms (as does the Ether coin). When we look at the ETH-to-BTC trading ratio, we can see that it’s in decline, suggesting that Ethereums future is holding them back. When compared to what Bitcoin is doing at this present moment, the situation becomes even more glaring. Ethereum’s path forward may require novel innovations and strategies to keep it competitive in the crypto space. Its worth as the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts is still quite solid. But Ethereum’s second act—to secure its place alongside Bitcoin as a truly dominant cryptocurrency—may require a payoff and a redefinition of its role that secures not just the fame of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, but also the future of the platform he invented. The future is still looking bright for Bitcoin, but the drop in AUM (assets under management) shows that not everyone is comfortable pouring more money into it. The investors who are still pouring money into it certainly seem to be taking it more in the way one might invest in gold, given the high fixed costs of mining Bitcoin, and the drop in issuance that is forecast to occur after the next halving. A huge question, though, is what will happen with inflation. If inflation rises significantly in the near future, and Bitcoin doesn’t go up much in price, it will be much less viable as an investable asset. Conclusion: A Market in Transition The fluctuating ETH/BTC ratio, moves in the opposite direction, and Bitcoin inflows continue to show just how complex and volatile the crypto market is. Nothing is certain, and the promise of Ethereum 2.0 is a big one. That said, should it take effect and realize its potential, Ethereum 2.0 will not restore Ethereum’s former glory and dominance overnight. Nothing less than the total overhaul of the system and a whole lot of time is going to get it there, if it gets there at all. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Despite the groundbreaking adoption, the market’s immediate response was a 3.6% dip in XRP’s price, a move that has puzzled many investors. X Finance Bull, in a recent post on X, highlighted the paradox of the crypto market, where meme coins can rally by double digits, yet significant advancements like this often struggle to gain immediate price traction. $XRP just helped launch a $71M tokenized securities platform. The market’s response? -3.6%. WhiteRock is live on XRPL. Tokenized stocks, bonds, gold, silver — with 3-second settlement. All regulated. All real. But the price dipped because… sentiment? Welcome to crypto, where… pic.twitter.com/ceUAOkM4XP — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) March 30, 2025 WhiteRock Goes Live on XRPL: A Game-Changer for Tokenized Securities The WhiteRock platform is now fully operational on the XRP Ledger , bringing tokenized stocks, bonds, gold, silver, and other real-world assets into the digital finance ecosystem. With three-second settlement times, complete regulatory compliance, and a robust infrastructure, WhiteRock aims to redefine how securities are traded and settled globally. Tokenization has long been heralded as the future of finance, allowing traditional assets to be digitized and traded with greater efficiency, security, and accessibility. The fact that this $71 million venture is backed by the XRP Ledger underscores the growing adoption of XRPL as a leading blockchain for financial applications. Why Did XRP’s Price Drop Instead of Rally? Despite this major milestone, XRP’s price declined by 3.6%, reflecting a common trend in the crypto space where fundamental adoption doesn’t always translate to immediate price action. Several factors could explain this reaction: Market Sentiment vs. Fundamentals: Cryptocurrency markets are often driven more by sentiment than by fundamentals. While tokenized securities represent a massive long-term use case for XRP and the XRPL ecosystem, the broader market may not be pricing in the significance of this development just yet. Short-Term Traders vs. Long-Term Investors: Many short-term traders react to the news with a sell-the-news approach, leading to price dips even after bullish developments. However, long-term investors see such innovations as building blocks for XRP’s future price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meme Coin Mania: As X Finance Bull pointed out, the crypto market sometimes favors hype and speculation over real utility. Meme coins and speculative tokens can pump 30% overnight, while projects with real-world adoption may see little to no immediate impact on price. The Bigger Picture for XRP and Tokenization While price action remains volatile, this launch is a massive step toward mainstream tokenization. Institutional players and regulatory bodies are increasingly recognizing the potential of blockchain-based securities, and the XRP Ledger is positioning itself as a major player in this space. As the market matures, projects like WhiteRock on XRPL could drive long-term value and adoption for XRP, even if the short-term price reaction doesn’t immediately reflect it. Investors with a long-term vision recognize that crypto isn’t just about hype cycles—it’s about patience and real-world impact.

            "BODY": "XRP is currently trading around $2.12, experiencing a 2.34% decline in the past 24 hours. After reaching a multi-year high of $3.40 two months ago, the token has pulled back nearly 40%, mirroring broader market trends. However, as technical indicators and macroeconomic factors align, traders are now closely watching for signs of a recovery and XRP’s potential to set a new all-time high (ATH). XRP’s Current Market Position The $2.00 level is proving to be a critical support zone for XRP. If buyers step in and defend this area, it could serve as a launch pad for the next upward move. Resistance remains at $2.20 and $2.50, with a successful breakout from these levels likely to trigger further gains. Key Catalysts for a Rebound Several factors could drive a strong rebound for XRP: Regulatory Clarity: A favorable outcome in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC could provide the regulatory green light needed for greater institutional adoption. Market Sentiment: If Bitcoin and the broader crypto market regain bullish momentum, XRP could follow suit. Adoption in Finance: As financial institutions increasingly integrate XRP for cross-border payments, demand could push prices higher. Pathway to a New ATH While XRP still has resistance to overcome, a break past $3.00 could pave the way for a run toward $4.00–$10.00 over the coming weeks. This outlook hinges on institutional adoption, legal clarity, and market cycles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Should XRP sustain momentum above $3.40, it could enter price discovery mode, testing previous highs and potentially setting new records. However, a failure to hold above $2.00 may delay a strong recovery, pushing prices toward $1.80 or lower in the short term. XRP stands at a pivotal point, with the market awaiting its next decisive move. A bullish breakout could set the stage for an ATH run, while downside risks remain if key support levels fail. Traders should remain vigilant, tracking regulatory developments and overall market trends as XRP shapes its next big move.

            "SOURCE_ID": 82,
            "BODY": "In a surprising turn of events for the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) space, X2Y2, a prominent NFT marketplace , has announced its impending closure. Effective April 30th, the platform will cease operations, marking the end of its journey as an NFT marketplace . This news, revealed by CEO TP on X, has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting questions and discussions about the future of NFT marketplaces and the broader digital asset landscape. Why is X2Y2 Shutting Down its NFT Marketplace? The primary reason cited for this drastic decision is a significant decline in NFT trading volume . According to the official announcement, X2Y2 has experienced a staggering 90% drop in trading activity. This dramatic decrease in user engagement and transaction volume has evidently made maintaining the NFT marketplace unsustainable for the platform. In the competitive world of digital assets, dwindling NFT trading volume can quickly erode profitability and long-term viability for any NFT marketplace . Several factors could contribute to this decline in NFT trading volume , including: Market Saturation: The NFT space has become increasingly crowded with numerous marketplaces vying for user attention and transaction fees. Competition is fierce, and newer platforms or those with stronger community backing may have captured market share. Broader Market Conditions: The overall cryptocurrency market sentiment can heavily influence NFT activity. Bear markets or periods of uncertainty often lead to reduced risk appetite, impacting the speculative nature of NFT trading. Shifting Trends: The NFT market itself is constantly evolving. Trends and popular collections change rapidly, and marketplaces need to adapt to stay relevant. X2Y2 might have struggled to keep pace with these dynamic shifts in NFT trading volume and user preferences. Fee Structures and Incentives: Marketplaces often compete on fees and incentives for both buyers and sellers. Changes in these structures or a lack of compelling features compared to competitors could have contributed to the decrease in NFT trading volume on X2Y2. A New Dawn: Pivoting to an AI-Powered Decentralized Yield Protocol While the sunsetting of the NFT marketplace might seem like an end, it simultaneously signals the beginning of a new chapter for the X2Y2 team. They are not exiting the crypto space; instead, they are strategically pivoting towards a different, potentially more lucrative and innovative area: a decentralized yield protocol powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This move suggests a forward-thinking approach, recognizing the evolving landscape and seeking opportunities in emerging technologies like AI crypto applications. But what exactly is a decentralized yield protocol , and how does AI crypto come into play? Let’s break it down: Decentralized Yield Protocol: In the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) realm, yield protocols allow users to earn passive income on their cryptocurrency holdings. This is often achieved through lending, staking, or providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges. Decentralization means these protocols operate without central intermediaries, relying on smart contracts for automation and security. AI-Powered: The integration of AI suggests that X2Y2 aims to create a yield protocol that is more intelligent, efficient, and potentially more profitable than existing solutions. AI algorithms can be used to optimize yield strategies, manage risk, and adapt to changing market conditions in real-time. This could involve: Automated Trading Strategies: AI could analyze market data to identify and execute optimal trading strategies for maximizing yield. Risk Management: AI can assess and mitigate risks associated with yield farming and DeFi protocols, potentially leading to safer and more stable returns. Personalized Yield Optimization: In the future, AI might even personalize yield strategies based on individual user risk profiles and investment goals. What are the Potential Benefits of an AI-Driven Decentralized Yield Protocol? The shift towards an AI crypto powered decentralized yield protocol could offer several compelling advantages: Enhanced Yield Potential: AI-driven strategies have the potential to outperform traditional, manual approaches to yield farming by identifying and capitalizing on fleeting market opportunities. Improved Risk Management: AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets and identify patterns that humans might miss, leading to better risk assessment and mitigation in the volatile DeFi space. Increased Efficiency and Automation: AI can automate complex yield farming processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and potentially lowering operational costs. Innovation in DeFi: Integrating AI into DeFi protocols represents a significant step towards creating more sophisticated and robust financial instruments. This AI crypto application could pave the way for a new generation of DeFi products. Attracting New Users: The promise of higher yields and AI-powered risk management could attract users who are currently hesitant to engage with DeFi due to its complexity and perceived risks. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the pivot to an AI crypto yield protocol is exciting, there are also challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Development Complexity: Building a sophisticated decentralized yield protocol powered by AI is a technically demanding undertaking. It requires expertise in both blockchain technology, DeFi mechanisms, and advanced AI/Machine Learning. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for both DeFi and AI in crypto is still evolving. X2Y2 will need to navigate potential regulatory hurdles as they develop and launch their new protocol. User Adoption: Convincing users to trust an AI-driven yield protocol will require transparency, security audits, and clear communication about the protocol’s workings and risk factors. Competition in DeFi Yield Protocols: The DeFi yield protocol space is already competitive. X2Y2 will need to differentiate its offering and demonstrate clear advantages over existing protocols to attract users and liquidity. AI Bias and Security: Ensuring that the AI algorithms are unbiased and secure is crucial. AI models can be susceptible to biases in the data they are trained on, and security vulnerabilities in AI systems could be exploited. What Does This Mean for NFT Traders and the Crypto Space? The closure of the X2Y2 NFT marketplace is undoubtedly a significant event for the NFT community. Users who actively traded on the platform will need to find alternative marketplaces. It also serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the crypto market. Marketplaces need to constantly innovate and adapt to survive and thrive. However, X2Y2’s pivot towards an AI crypto powered decentralized yield protocol is a fascinating development. It showcases the industry’s ability to evolve and explore new frontiers. The success of this new venture could have broader implications for the integration of AI in DeFi and the development of more intelligent and automated financial solutions within the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Move into the Future of Crypto X2Y2’s decision to shut down its NFT marketplace and venture into the realm of AI crypto and decentralized yield protocol development is a bold and potentially transformative move. While the closure of any platform is always noteworthy, especially for its users, this pivot reflects a strategic vision to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies within the crypto space. The future of X2Y2 now hinges on its ability to successfully build and launch a compelling and secure AI-powered decentralized yield protocol . This transition will be closely watched by the crypto community as it unfolds, offering valuable insights into the evolving intersection of NFTs, DeFi, and Artificial Intelligence.

            "BODY": "Here's the latest from the crypto market as major altcoins shape up for what experts call the Q2 of growth. From Chainlink price prediction to the latest AVAX news, experts and investors are torn between holding for what is to come and keying into a more promising prospect in the real wildcard of 2025, the Panshibi ($SHIBI) project! This article has all the details you need to understand what experts forecast for Chainlinkprice, the latest AVAX news, and Panshibi’s skyrocketing potential. Chainlink Price Prediction Amid Market Uncertainty Chainlink price has witnessed significant volatility , with technical analysis showing its bearish momentum. Chainlink price action is setting up a head-and-shoulders pattern and constantly failing to stay above key Fibonacci marks. While these short-term worries exist, Chainlink’s core strengths have kept hopes alive within its ecosystem. For top crypto experts and analysts , Chainlink price prediction suggests another rally ahead this year based on its prevalent position in decentralized Oracle solutions and growing use cases in DeFi and cross-chain interoperability. Similarly, the project’s strategic partnerships, which include collaborations with top financial institutions growing into Web3, are expected to improve Chainlink price bullish chances further. Latest Avalanche (AVAX) News Stress Bearish Pressure Avalanche (AVAX) has plunged below its crucial support, as it now trades at $19.63 , its lowest price mark since November 2024. This drop follows a 28.7% dip in the past month, no thanks to selling pressure and weak liquidity. According to the Money Flow Index (MFI), there's not enough buying pressure to match, implying a further downtrend ahead. After breaching resistance zones around $27.89 and $51.88, a recovery appears even more doubtful and safe for a significant buying momentum, which might still be momentary. While there's been growth in daily transactions, weak liquidity metrics leave worrying signs concerning the network’s financial health and chances of sustaining long-term growth. The feeling among investors remains cautious, as AVAX whale holdings have fallen from 26.53 million to 25.59 million since the start of the year. More holdings have also been lost, mirroring uncertainty due to decreasing liquidity. Avalanche's subsequent trajectory rests on its capacity to stabilize liquidity while growing favorable network activity. Should the price bounce back beyond $35, experts say bearish pressure may drive it further down, possibly below $20. Panshibi ($SHIBI) is Set To Outdo Chainlink and AVAX Seasoned crypto traders, especially those who have invested in Chainlink and Avalanche, now have their sights set on Panshibi as the next big opportunity. Panshibi is a fast-rising meme coin that combines Social-Fi and AI features to create a solid, engaged community. Thanks to its range of use cases, including a Stake-to-Earn feature offering up to 1,200% APY, Panshibi is well-positioned to set a new record in the meme coin market. Experts tip it to become the largest Asian-inspired meme coin this year and outdo more established tokens. With the Panshibi presale capped at $10 million and set to run across 15 presale stages, all is set for a value-driven token launch. With every stage, $SHIBI’s price increases, rewarding early adopters with more profits. Panshibi leverages its strong community support and unique incentives to become a prime contender for exponential growth in 2025. Whales and savvy investors are accumulating $SHIBI, understanding that early adopters are best poised to ride the next wave of this meme coin's success.

            "BODY": "South Korea’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bithumb, has turned around impressively during 2024, and it now finds itself in the black, with operating profits of $89 million and a reported net profit of $110 million. Just last year, in 2023, the exchange suffered a gigantic operating loss, so the profits this year mark an increase of more than half a billion dollars. South Korea's second largest cryptocurrency Bithumb showed that its operating profit turned into a surplus last year, reaching $89 million. Bithumb's operating loss in 2023 was 14.8 billion won, and its net profit last year was 110 million US dollars, an increase of 565.8% over… https://t.co/VeYtT9mxih — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 31, 2025 Those profits have cryptography aficionados curious about what’s happening at Bithumb and in the South Korean virtual asset market in general. Bithumb’s Financial Resurgence In 2023, Bithumb had a troublesome year and presented an operating loss of 14.8 billion South Korean won. The company was in trouble, but it was part of a broadly downward-moving market for cryptocurrency firms, which had been under pressure from regulators and seen trading volume drop. Even in the midst of this turmoil, Bithumb undertook some restructuring and tried to run the firm with a little more efficiency and a little more focus on some key strategic initiatives. As a result of these efforts, the firm turned a significant profit in 2024 and presented an operating profit of $89 million. This is a significant turnaround and marks Bithumb’s resilience amid the tough conditions facing the cryptocurrency industry. The net profit of $110 million illustrates just how much the exchange has recovered, amid the growth of its user base and trading activities. In no way does this reflect a downtrend in the cryptocurrency market. This was an extremely difficult year for many exchanges—the weakness in the cryptocurrency market presented several challenges to managing an exchange profitably. And yet here is Bithumb, a major player in the exchange world, and it looks to be healthy again. Bithumb’s rebound marks a success not only for the company itself but also for the cryptocurrency trading space in South Korea. The exchange fell under suspicion and was for a time presumed to be insolvent. Despite Bithumb’s setbacks, it appears cryptocurrencies and platforms for trading them are accepted more and more within South Korea’s financial landscape. Growing Cryptocurrency Adoption in South Korea Bithumb’s recovery comes as South Korea experiences a surge in adopting cryptocurrencies. The use of virtual assets soared over the past few years, Seoul’s once virtual asset exchanges now promising a user base of 16.29 million. SBS said that number was reached this past February; it means about 32% of the population now interacts with some type of virtual asset exchange, and it places our virtual asset user base ahead of the traditional Korean stock market user base. According to SBS, as of the end of February 2025, South Korea's virtual asset exchanges had a total of 16.29 million users, accounting for about 32% of the population and surpassing the 14.1 million stock market investors. The figure includes duplicated users, as it combines… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 30, 2025 The figure of 16.29 million users, which includes duplicated accounts across the five major cryptocurrency exchanges, reflects the increasing participation in the crypto space by South Koreans. The growing user base underscores the nation’s standing as one of the globe’s most crypto-fluent. Adoption proceeds apace, with more individuals—not just the under-30 set—seeking to invest in digital assets. They’re spurred by the prospect of potentially high returns and a burgeoning comprehension of blockchain technology. The data also points to a substantial increase in the institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, with exchanges like Bithumb observing a surge in not just trading volumes but also retail and institutional investor engagement. The almost exponential growth of the user base during the past year has pushed exchanges to not only innovate their offerings but to also significantly enhance their security measures and expand their service range to a more diverse customer base. More and more users are partaking in the cryptocurrency markets, reflecting a global trend where digital currencies are becoming ever more mainstream. South Korea is at the very tip of the adoption spear. And as the number of crypto investors here in South Korea surpasses that of stock market participants, it is becoming integral to our financial ecosystem. Challenges Ahead for South Korea’s Crypto Exchanges In spite of a favorable trend, the cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea are still confronting regulatory challenges that would seem to threaten their long-term viability. The government has been dealing with the sector in a very conservatively pro-regulation manner in response to its worries about a number of issues: the potential for money laundering, the need to protect investors, and the overall worry that virtual currencies may be subject to market manipulation. The recent actions of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) in particular seem to put all of these worries into high relief. In addition, the ongoing instability of the cryptocurrency market necessitates that exchanges remain nimble and quick to adjust to altering market conditions. While Bithumb might be having a strong recovery in 2024, the market could just as easily shift, and exchanges must be investing in infrastructure, security, and innovation to maintain their competitive edge. In spite of these difficulties, the overall cryptocurrency market in South Korea stays strong, and the surging user numbers point to its prospect as a serious player in the global digital asset arena. Embracing cryptocurrency as an alternative form of investment, a fast-increasing number of South Koreans are calling for exchanges like Bithumb that are the very picture of secure, reliable, and innovative. Despite the recent turmoil in the crypto markets, user numbers for Bithumb reached a record high in 2022. Conclusion: A Positive Outlook for Bithumb and the Korean Crypto Market Bithumb’s financial turnaround in 2024 is a promising sign for the company and the broader South Korean cryptocurrency market. The exchange’s substantial recovery from a significant loss to an operating profit of $89 million underscores its resilience and adaptability in a swiftly changing market. Meanwhile, as cryptocurrency adoption in South Korea rises apace—with more than 16 million users trading virtual assets—the outlook for Bithumb seems increasingly rosy. The ongoing regulatory issues and market volatility will keep testing the flexibility of South Korea’s crypto exchanges. Yet—and it’s a big yet—the altitude of the country and the incipient quantity still suggest otherwise. Here, from my perch, the perceived quantity keeps coming, and the inbound interest remains ever-increasing. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "The Solana (SOL) community is actively discussing increasing the network's Compute Unit (CU) capacity, a crucial metric that regulates transaction complexity and saves network resources. Compute Units function similarly to Ethereum's gas fees, ensuring transaction efficiency and protecting the blockchain from excessive computing demands. Currently, Solana’s block limit is set at 48 million CUs. However, recent proposals, including SIMD-0207 and SIMD-0256, suggest increasing this limit to improve network performance. SIMD-0207 suggests a modest increase to 50 million CUs, while SIMD-0256 advocates a more significant increase to 60 million CUs. Solana developers state that the current block limits serve to maintain network stability by ensuring that the majority of participants can keep up with the transaction process. However, they note that current mainnet traffic is not significantly constrained by block execution times, leaving room for capacity expansion. “The primary purpose of block limits is to ensure that network participants can keep up with block transactions,” Solana developers said. “This proposal targets a significant increase to 60 million CUs to provide additional capacity without straining the network.” Related News: JUST IN: Eric Trump, Who Said “Buy Ethereum” Before The Big Fall, Now Announces His New Bitcoin Move Alternative strategies also featured in the discussion on CU expansion: Not changing block limits: This approach maintains network stability but leaves potential capacity unused. A larger increase to 96 million CUs: This is currently considered too aggressive as it could lead to unforeseen challenges, particularly impacting the infrastructure supporting the turbine protocol and users. Rather than making a radical change, developers prefer to make a gradual increase in CU limits to align with ongoing improvements in network performance. *This is not investment advice.

            "BODY": "Solana has fallen by 1% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $124 as the crypto market as a whole falls by 4% today. SOL remains down by 11% in a week and by 113% in a month, with the sixth-biggest coin in the market also suffering a 36% decline in the past year. However, it has been able to deflect some of the wider market’s losses today thanks to the recent launch of Solana-based DEX PumpSwap, which since launching nearly two weeks ago has passed $2.5 billion in cumulative trading volume . This is an impressive figure four such a new and niche platform, and it ultimately points to Solana’s future growth potential, particularly when market conditions become more favorable again. Solana Set to Reclaim $200? PumpSwap’s $2.5B Launch Puts DEX Fuel Behind SOL Launched by the team behind the Pump.fun meme token launchpad, PumpSwap is a new DEX that will directly list tokens created via its parent platform. This direct link with Pump.fun arguably gives it a competitive edge over other (Solana-based) DEXes and AMMs, such as Raydium. Bullishly, it has already expanded from $23.8 million volume on March 20 to a peak of $348 million only four days later. Source: Dune It has since trailed off a little, but figures still remain fairly high at $203.5 million yesterday, indicating that it has largely consolidated its growth. Of course, the big question is whether PumpSwap will help generate additional meme token volume, or will simply take volume away from existing Solana DEXes. Well, looking at the volumes for the aforementioned Raydium, for example, its TVL has remained pretty constant since PumpSwap’s launch, at around $1.2 billion. This suggests that PumpSwap could help grow Solana-based token trading overall, adding efficiencies and value to the token creation and launchpad services offered by Pump.fun. Its arrival is therefore highly bullish for Solana, which at the very least has avoided falling as steeply as the rest of the market today. Source: TradingView And as we’ve reported in recent days, its indicators look like they’ve bottomed out already, with SOL due a big recovery sooner or later. Its RSI (purple) had risen back towards 50 in the past week, and looks like it’s still on a medium-term upwards climb. At the same time, it’s arguable that Solana’s 30-day average (orange) can’t get any lower in relation to the 200-day (blue), again pointing to an eventual recovery. So when coupled with Solana’s almost peerless fundamentals, SOL’s price should recover in the coming months. It could return to $200 by June, and hit $260 by Q4. Layer-Two Tokens Show Big Growth Potential Now is a very good time for the Solana ecosystem, with many of its associated tokens likely to rally strongly in the medium- and long-term. This even includes new tokens that haven’t even launched, with layer-two coin Solaxy (SOLX) being one of the most promising new projects in the space. It has already raised $28.6 million in its ongoing presale, which is a very strong sign of how well it could do once it goes live. Plug in. Launch. Scale. #SOLX https://t.co/mdaTX9aVVx pic.twitter.com/wGYXUNJ6eo — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) March 30, 2025 And it also boasts over 74,000 followers on X , which again is a sign of how popular it could become. The reason why it’s doing so well is that it’s in the process of launching Solana’s first true layer-network, one which will make the Solana experience cheaper and easier for users. It will provide lower fees and faster confirmation times, while also enabling instant bridging, including with chains other than Solana. Importantly, it will help Solana users avoid the delays and dropped transactions that can still affect the layer-one network, even with recent network upgrades. Investors can join the SOLX presale by going to the Solaxy website , with their tokens open for staking as soon as they purchase them. SOLX currently costs $0.00168, although this will rise again in two days. The post Solana Set to Reclaim $200? PumpSwap’s $2.5B Launch Puts DEX Fuel Behind SOL appeared first on Cryptonews .",

            "BODY": "Every crypto cycle has its winners—the projects that start small, gain momentum, and eventually dominate the market. Terra Classic was once a top contender, making waves before its dramatic fall, and Aptos emerged as a promising Layer-1 blockchain touted as the next Solana. While both have had their moments in the spotlight, the question now is whether they still hold best cryptos with 1000X potential or if the real opportunity lies elsewhere. This is where Qubetics enters the conversation. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics isn’t just building another blockchain—it’s creating a Web3 aggregator that unites the biggest networks under one seamless ecosystem. With Qubetics currently in its 28th presale stage at $0.1430 per $TICS, early adopters have a chance to secure tokens before the price jumps again. As the market gears up for another wave of crypto hype, this project is gaining serious attention. The question now isn’t whether Qubetics has potential—it’s whether those who missed out on Terra Classic’s early days or Aptos’ initial surge will let another golden opportunity slip away. Qubetics Wallet – The Future of Multi-Chain Transactions Managing multiple cryptocurrencies has always been a challenge. Users often juggle several wallets, deal with complex bridges, and face frustrating limitations when moving assets across blockchains. Qubetics is solving this problem with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a revolutionary solution that allows seamless transactions across major networks.

With its innovative approach to DeFi, Qubetics is solidifying its place among the best cryptos with 1000X potential, providing traders with a next-level experience that maximizes efficiency and profitability. Qubetics Presale – The Window for Massive Gains is Closing The numbers tell a clear story—Qubetics’ presale is attracting significant traction, and those securing tokens now are positioning themselves for substantial returns. With each presale stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price increase occurring every Sunday at 12 AM, hesitation means missing out on the best entry points. The current presale is buzzing at Stage 28, with each $TICS token going for just $0.1430. Numbers don’t lie—over $15.5 million has already poured in, with more than 23,900 token holders and over 504 million tokens flying off the shelf. .At the current presale price of $0.1430 per $TICS, early buyers stand to gain massively if the token reaches its projected post-presale milestones. Looking further ahead, once Qubetics establishes its mainnet, the real potential unfolds. If $TICS hits $1, that translates to 599.21% ROI. At $5, it skyrockets to 3,396.06%, and at $10, the return grows to 6,892.12%. A price of $15 would mean an astonishing 10,388.18% ROI. For example, an investment of $500 today at the current presale price would result in $3,995 if $TICS reaches just $1. If it hits $15, that same $500 turns into $51,940. With the Qubetics mainnet launching in Q2 2025, those getting in now have a rare chance to enter before the project reaches its full potential. Terra Classic – Can It Stage a Comeback? Once a dominant force in crypto, Terra Classic (LUNC) suffered one of the most dramatic collapses in blockchain history. Despite the setback, the community has kept the project alive, with ongoing development efforts aimed at revitalizing the network. One of the most significant updates includes an aggressive token burn mechanism, which reduces the total supply in hopes of increasing scarcity and value. Additionally, efforts to reintegrate DeFi applications on Terra Classic’s chain are gaining momentum, signaling potential for renewed activity. However, the road to recovery is uncertain. While speculative interest keeps LUNC relevant, many remain skeptical about whether it can fully regain its former status. The coin’s extreme volatility presents both risks and rewards, making it a high-stakes asset for those looking to capitalize on short-term market swings. Aptos – The Layer-1 with Big Ambitions Aptos launched with bold claims of being a Solana competitor, boasting a high-speed Layer-1 blockchain built on the Move programming language. Initially, it generated significant excitement, with its token seeing massive early adoption. However, as the dust settled, the network struggled with congestion issues and user adoption hurdles. Recently, Aptos has shifted focus toward strengthening its NFT and DeFi ecosystem, aiming to attract developers and projects looking for alternatives to Ethereum and Solana. Institutional partnerships have added credibility to the project, but challenges remain in scalability and long-term sustainability. With multiple Layer-1 blockchains competing for dominance, Aptos must prove its ability to maintain relevance in a crowded market. Final Thoughts – Which Crypto Holds the 1000X Potential? Each of these projects has its strengths, but not all hold the same level of upside. Terra Classic relies on community-driven efforts and speculation, making it a volatile but uncertain bet. Aptos has strong fundamentals and institutional backing, yet still struggles with broader adoption. In contrast, Qubetics is actively solving real-world problems, bringing unmatched multi-chain functionality, DeFi integration, and real-world payment solutions to the blockchain space. With the Qubetics presale still live at $0.1430 and set to increase soon, those who recognize its potential have an opportunity to join this crypto presale before the price rises further. With its mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, this could be the next big name in crypto. The choice is clear—those who get in now might just be looking at one of the best cryptos with 1000X potential.

            "BODY": "A big shift has happened in the NFT marketplace. X2Y2 , once a big competitor to OpenSea, is shutting down. X2Y2 could not stop the bleeding after its trading volume fell a staggering 90 percent from its peak. Despite having done $5.6 billion in business during its three years of living, it will close the doors on April 30, 2025. Its smart contracts remain in existence, so users can still access and trade X2Y2 NFTs. The Rise and Fall of X2Y2 Started only three years ago, X2Y2 swiftly became one of the top NFT platforms on the market. Its singular way of doing business and the introduction of cool new tools caused the marketplace to snag a hefty 15% of the fast-growing NFT sector. In October of last year, we had a peak month with X2Y2 ranking as the second-largest NFT marketplace by trading volume with $5.6 billion processed across its platform. The swift expansion of the NFT space came to an unexpected stop in 2022. In common with many other platforms, X2Y2 struggled to keep its head above water as the tide of market enthusiasm receded and the NFT sector in general showed clear signs of slowing down. The platform started strong and looked like a contender, managing to pull in a nice amount of trading activity. But as the market headed in a different direction, it pretty much just floundered, unable to keep pace with larger competitors like OpenSea. Broader market trends impacted trading volume and competition. NFT marketplace @the_x2y2 is shutting down following a 90% decline in #NFT trading volume. Since launching three years ago, it has processed $5.6B in transactions, according to TokenTerminal. Operations will end on April 30, but smart contracts will remain active. The team… pic.twitter.com/YaPNUBe3ut — Mpost Media Group (@mpost_io) March 31, 2025 The 90% drop in trading volume was a direct reflection of these broader market trends. The decline in demand for NFTs, combined with tough competition and the rise of other new NFT marketplaces, led to X2Y2’s user base and trading activity largely evaporating. As the market went through a period of consolidation, smaller platforms like X2Y2 were hit the hardest, unable to generate sufficient user interest to keep from being largely moribund. X2Y2 has struggled to maintain viability in an increasingly selective NFT sector that is growing fast but also maturing. With trading activity down and user growth stagnant, X2Y2 undertook an exercise in completely reevaluating its revenue model. The main problem? The company’s cash register was largely silent. A Shift Toward the Future: X2Y2’s Pivot to AI and Crypto The X2Y2 team is positive about what lies ahead, even though they have shut down their marketplace. They say they are now heavily invested in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and its exciting intersection with cryptocurrency. “We are deep in the AI space, exploring how it intersects with crypto in powerful new ways,” they said. And this is not just idle conversation; it represents a serious pivot away from the declining NFT sector toward artificial intelligence and its potentially broad disruptions of the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems. The area where AI and crypto meet is gaining a lot of attention in the tech world. The team at X2Y2, a crypto startup that focuses on NFTs, is using its blockchain knowledge to investigate the rapidly expanding world of AI for potential synergies that could lead to something big. X2Y2’s new AI-play is a bit of a mystery; they haven’t said much about it. But with two of the hottest tech domains right now converging, it’s worth catching up. Even though X2Y2’s closure puts an end to the era for the platform, the team’s pivot to AI is thinking ahead as they try to explore new paths in the changing marketplace. The shift from NFTs to AI could, in my opinion, give them the flexibility they need to stay relevant as the crypto world continues to grow up. The State of the NFT Market and What Lies Ahead Closing down is a trend that is affecting several NFT platforms. The infatuation with NFTs in 2021 and 2022 spun off a number of new projects and platforms. Since then, we have seen a downturn in the market, with trading volumes dropping and overall interest waning. Meanwhile, several platforms have found it impossible to keep their user numbers growing and their virtual coffers filling. The NFT market has become more competitive. Larger platforms like OpenSea, along with newer entrants, continue to dominate the space. The market is far from dead. But the slowdown has forced many smaller projects and platforms to reevaluate their positions. For some, like X2Y2, the decision to shut down was probably inevitable. But NFTs remain an integral part of the crypto ecosystem. And despite the challenges faced by marketplace platforms like X2Y2, many observers think the sector will eventually find new growth and opportunities. In the future, perhaps the focus will turn to NFT projects with much more sustainable models, projects with plenty of real-world utility, and innovation in sectors like gaming, art, and our ever-expanding virtual worlds. NFTs that deliver real, tangible value and solve real, concrete problems may just be the market-revitalization elixir we need to see in the next couple of years. Lurking toward AI and crypto innovation, X2Y2 looks to be adapting its quite-visible company model toward something much more aligned with the whole crypto world evolving these days. Conclusion: A Market in Flux X2Y2’s closure serves as a poignant reminder of the volatility and uncertainty that exists within the NFT space. The once-robust marketplace—acting as a secondary marketplace for NFTs—has seen a rapid decrease in trading volume lately. X2Y2’s parent company, and the team behind the marketplace, are exploring AI and crypto. The NFT market is still nascent but quite fluid. The latest shift concerns projects with “real-world utility” next to their supposed “revolutionary nature” and, as such, X2Y2’s exit seems to reflect a broader trend away from serviceable NFT exchanges. The good news, however, is that the people involved in X2Y2 don’t operate in a vacuum. They can take what they learned from building an NFT exchange and apply it to whatever they choose next. And the next chapter in the NFT story will probably be one of those “real-world projects” that critics keep asking for. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

With characteristic rhetoric and a protectionist stance, Trump plans to roll out sweeping new tariffs aimed at countries perceived as having unfair trade advantages over the United States. This move, foreshadowed by earlier announcements and rising global trade tensions, could redefine America’s engagement in global commerce. As April 2 approaches, businesses and foreign governments brace for aggressive trade actions ostensibly designed to revive US domestic industries and curb long-standing trade deficits.

The developer behind the dashboard @tomwanhh reports that a staggering 880 million USDe were unstaked over the last four days. This has evidently led to some market surprises with analysts, because the annual percentage yield (APY) for USDe stakers has risen sharply during the same time. From myteam, the report was shared that the APY now appears to be around 9.2%, where it had previously been around 3.5% just a few days prior. A Shift in Staking Behavior: Unstaking Volume and Rising APY In the last few days, the most remarkable change has been the rapid decrease in the amount of USDe that was staked on the platform. In only four days, there were 880 million USDe unstaked, and the staking ratio fell from a fairly solid 58% to a much less impressive 43%. This signifies a considerable drop in the amount of USDe that is being utilized to secure network operations and earn staking rewards, thereby raising some eyebrows and causing some sea plus over potential liquidity issues and the long-term sustainability of the staking model. It is interesting to note that even though the amount of USDe that is staked has gone down, the daily APY that is paid to stakers has shot up from 3.5% to 9.2%. This is, of course, a good development for those who are still holding USDe in staking positions, as the rewards are now more than twice as attractive as they were just days ago. But could this rise in APY also mean that something is amiss with the market? Generally speaking, higher yields are a sign that a lot of assets are leaving staking, which could imply reduced confidence in the platform. Though the APY increase is attractive for current stakers, it raises questions about network stability. Lower USDe lockup means a possibly decrease in protocol resiliency, and the broader ecosystem health, if this trend persists. Abraxas Capital’s Large Redemptions: A Closer Look at the Data One of the main reasons for this latest surge in unstaking activity seems to be the big institutional redemptions, with Abraxas Capital appearing to lead the way. Reported Arkham data suggests Abraxas Capital has redeemed a total of 330 million USDe thus far, which is a significant part of the total of 880 million USDe unstaked in recent days. (This was all prior to yesterday’s continued market dip.) Arkham also seems to suggest that these redemptions are connected to the recent maturity of the Pendle sUSDe pool. 1/ 880M USDe was unstaked in the past 4 days 2/ The staking ratio decreased from 58% to 43% 3/ Silver Lining? Daily average APY shoot back up from 3.5% to 9.2% 4/ Top Unstaking Addresses According to Arkham's label, 330M unstaking volume comes from Abraxas Capital pic.twitter.com/uzKMIwZcH9 — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) March 31, 2025 Pendle’s sUSDe pool, a prominent DeFi instrument, has played a major role in incentivizing users to lock their USDe in exchange for yields. However, the maturity of these pools often leads to a period of liquidity events, with large players like Abraxas Capital redeeming significant portions of their positions. The timing of these redemptions appears to be the catalyst for the sudden shift in staking behavior and the subsequent drop in the staking ratio. The influence of these extensive redemptions is serious. They might lead to a real decrease in the amount of USDe that is available for people to use. If Abraxas Capital keeps cashing in its USDe, we’re close to a situation where there might only be 3.something billion USDe usable in the world. That’s less than 4 billion, which some experts see as the floor for how many USDe there should be in circulation for the market to work kind of okay and not be super volatile. What Does This Mean for USDe’s Future? While the USDe stablecoin adjusts to these changes, many are left to wonder what they mean for the token’s future. Now that a significant portion of the USDe token is unstaked, goes the thinking, will other large players follow suit and start redeeming their held tokens? If this trend continues, the token’s supply could be further reduced, which would impact its price and its overall stability within the DeFi market. Additionally, the instantaneous spike in APY could draw in new folks wanting to benefit from the higher rewards, yet it might also be a sign of some deep-rooted issues with the protocol’s staking model. A sharp spike in APY is almost always because there’s been a dip in participation, and while it could seem a positive development for those USDe-staking, it might also be an indicator that the protocol is having a tough time balancing all the necessary elements to maintain the long-term growth we should be able to expect. The future of the USDe also may depend on how rapidly Abraxas Capital and other big players decide to redeem their holdings. If these institutional players continue to redeem large amounts, it could lead to a further drop in the staking ratio and an even more pronounced tightening of liquidity in the market. Conversely, if these whales decide to hold their positions and allow the staking ratio to recover, the protocol may avoid more significant disruption and may stabilize in the short term. Looking Ahead: Will the Ecosystem Stabilize? In the end, the next several days and weeks will be all-important in setting the course of USDe. That the staking ratio is going down, while the redemptions from Abraxas Capital are very large, could signal that we’re at the beginning of a larger trend. Or it could prove to be a short-term liquidity event that the ecosystem has no trouble overcoming. Whatever the case, market participants are on high alert and with good reason. They want to see the protocol stabilize. They want to see it overcome the challenges it’s currently facing and continue to thrive. Currently, the increase in APY may offer stakers some temporary inducements, but the USDe ecosystem’s long-term viability will rest on its ability to hold onto liquidity, keep a nutritious staking ratio, and survive what could be further redemption strains. The DeFi space remains as unpredictable as ever, and only time will tell how these developments will resolve themselves. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "Are you feeling the chills of fear gripping the crypto market? Or perhaps sensing a glimmer of greed on the horizon? Understanding the emotional pulse of the cryptocurrency market is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a vital tool that attempts to quantify these very emotions. Let’s dive into the latest reading and decipher what it signals for your crypto strategy. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Fear Persists As of March 31st, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely recognized gauge of market sentiment provided by Alternative, registered a score of 34. This marks a slight uptick of two points from the previous day. While any increase might seem encouraging, it’s crucial to note that the index remains firmly entrenched in the “Fear” zone. This persistent fear, despite the marginal improvement, paints a picture of cautious, if not anxious, investor behavior within the cryptocurrency space. But what exactly does this index measure, and why should you care? Let’s break it down: Range: The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. 0-24: Represents “Extreme Fear,” indicating investors are excessively worried, often signaling potential buying opportunities. 25-49: “Fear” zone, suggesting caution and uncertainty prevail in the market. 50-74: “Greed” zone, indicating growing optimism and potential market exuberance. 75-100: “Extreme Greed,” signaling excessive market optimism, which can sometimes precede market corrections. Currently sitting at 34, we are still in the “Fear” zone. This implies that while there might be a slight easing of negative sentiment compared to the previous day, overall, the crypto market participants are still exhibiting more fear than greed. What Drives the Fear and Greed Index? Unpacking the Metrics The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number pulled from thin air. It’s a composite index, meticulously calculated by weighing six distinct market factors. Each factor provides a different perspective on market sentiment, contributing to the overall index score. Let’s explore these components in detail: Volatility (25% Weight): Volatility measures the rapid and unpredictable price swings in the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin. High volatility often triggers fear as investors become wary of potential losses. The index analyzes the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin to gauge this fear factor. Market Momentum/Volume (25% Weight): This factor examines market momentum by comparing the current market momentum and volume against the past 30 and 90-day averages. Strong buying momentum and high trading volumes can suggest growing greed, while weak momentum and low volume might indicate fear or uncertainty. Social Media (15% Weight): Social media sentiment plays a significant role in shaping market perceptions. The index analyzes social media platforms, primarily Twitter and Reddit, for crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates. An increase in positive crypto mentions and engagement can signal growing greed, whereas negative sentiment can contribute to fear. Surveys (15% Weight): While currently paused, surveys were previously used to directly gauge investor sentiment. These polls asked participants about their current market views, providing a direct measure of fear or greed. When active, survey results were a valuable input to the index. Bitcoin Dominance (10% Weight): Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a “flight to safety” during periods of fear, as investors move away from riskier altcoins and towards the perceived stability of Bitcoin. Conversely, decreasing Bitcoin dominance might suggest growing greed as investors become more comfortable with altcoins. Google Trends (10% Weight): Google Trends data analyzes the search volume for various Bitcoin-related search queries. Increased search interest in terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often indicates fear, while rising searches for “Bitcoin buy” can suggest growing greed and investment interest. By combining these six diverse data points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to provide a holistic view of the prevailing market sentiment in the crypto space. Navigating Market Volatility: Why Does the ‘Fear’ Zone Matter? Understanding that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently in the “Fear” zone is more than just an interesting data point; it has practical implications for your crypto investment strategy. Here’s why it matters: Investor Psychology: The index reflects the collective emotional state of the crypto market. Fear can lead to impulsive selling and missed buying opportunities, while excessive greed can result in irrational exuberance and market bubbles. Recognizing these emotional biases is crucial for making rational decisions. Potential Buying Opportunities: Historically, periods of extreme fear (index values below 25) have often presented compelling buying opportunities. When fear is rampant, asset prices can be driven down to undervalued levels, offering patient investors a chance to accumulate crypto at a discount. Risk Management: Conversely, periods of extreme greed (index values above 75) can signal increased market risk. High greed can indicate that the market is overextended and potentially due for a correction. In such times, it might be prudent to take profits or reduce exposure to riskier assets. Confirmation Tool: The index should not be used in isolation but rather as a confirmation tool alongside other technical and fundamental analysis. It can help validate your own market assessment and provide additional context to your investment decisions. It’s essential to remember that the crypto fear and greed index is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty. However, it provides valuable insights into the prevailing market psychology, which can be a powerful tool in your investment toolkit. Actionable Insights: Leveraging the Fear & Greed Index for Smarter Crypto Decisions So, how can you practically use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to enhance your crypto investment strategy? Here are some actionable insights: Long-Term Investors: Consider periods of “Extreme Fear” as potential accumulation phases. When the market is fearful, it often presents opportunities to buy quality crypto assets at lower prices. Think of it as “buying when others are fearful.” Short-Term Traders: Use the index in conjunction with technical analysis. A sudden spike in fear during a downtrend might signal potential capitulation and a possible short-term bounce. Conversely, extreme greed during an uptrend could indicate an overheated market and a potential pullback. Risk Management: Monitor the index to gauge overall market risk. As the index moves towards “Extreme Greed,” consider tightening your stop-loss orders or taking some profits off the table to protect your portfolio. Diversification: The index can also indirectly inform your diversification strategy. During periods of fear, Bitcoin dominance might increase, suggesting a preference for Bitcoin over altcoins. Adjust your portfolio allocation accordingly based on your risk tolerance and market assessment. Stay Informed: Regularly check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and understand the factors driving its movements. This will help you stay attuned to market sentiment shifts and make more informed decisions. Remember, the key is to use the index as one piece of the puzzle in your overall crypto investment strategy. Combine it with your own research, analysis, and risk management framework for a more robust and informed approach. Conclusion: Embracing Market Sentiment for Informed Crypto Investing The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, currently at 34 and lingering in the “Fear” zone, serves as a crucial reminder of the emotional rollercoaster that is the cryptocurrency market. While the slight increase from the previous day offers a glimmer of potential improvement, the prevailing sentiment remains cautious. By understanding the factors that influence this index – from volatility and market momentum to social media buzz and Bitcoin dominance – you gain a powerful tool to interpret market psychology. Don’t let fear paralyze you or greed cloud your judgment. Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a compass to navigate market sentiment, identify potential opportunities, and manage risk effectively. In the volatile world of crypto, emotional intelligence, guided by data-driven insights like the Fear & Greed Index, can be your greatest asset.

            "BODY": "Ethereum’s ($ETH) price is once again in the spotlight, and for two whales that hold a combined 125,603 ETH (worth approximately $229 million, anyway) on MakerDAO, we very seriously hope that the price of ETH holds above $1,787.75 and $1,701.54, respectively. Because if not, those positions will get liquidated, and that’s liable to create all the same kinds of market shockwaves associated with liquidation events: rising ETH supply, falling ETH price, and also quite possibly some event-driven volatility in MakerDAO’s DAI. Even though the Ethereum market has seen major liquidations in the past, each time the asset has shown resilience and managed to bounce back. This latest development raises crucial questions about the ETH market’s stability and whether or not these whales will step in to prevent further price declines or if a broader cascade of liquidations is imminent. The Threat of Liquidation: Will ETH See a Sell-Off? The two whales in question presently hold a large share of ETH on MakerDAO, a well-liked decentralized lending protocol. The positions of these whales are now in danger of being liquidated if ETH’s price keeps sliding. At the current price levels, a drop to either $1,787.75 or $1,701.54 would trigger a forced sale of their holdings. The $ETH liquidation threat is very real—but whether it actually happens depends on price action. The two whales holding 125,603 ETH ($229M) on MakerDAO are dangerously close to #liquidation . If ETH drops to $1,787.75 and $1,701.54, their positions will be force-sold, pic.twitter.com/ha56C360wE — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) March 31, 2025 In the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, one of the most well-known platforms is MakerDAO. It enables users to take out loans. But the twist is that these loans are only made against collateral. The most common form of collateral is ETH. When ETH’s price drops, and it drops a lot below certain thresholds, the Maker collateral backing the DAI stablecoin becomes insufficient. At that point, the Maker system kicks in and starts liquidating the loans. And what we’ve seen is that in recent days, due to certain whales holding vast amounts of DAI, the amount of ETH hitting the market has been significant. This situation is worrisome for ETH holders, as the possibility of liquidation by these whales could send their ETH into the open market. And from what we know about ETH in the current market, sending a ton of it into the open market in a short period of time could have devastating price effects. Once those price effects ripple through the rest of the market, it won’t take much for panic to set in. And then those cascading liquidation effects we mentioned earlier will start to happen. Even under today’s market duress, it must be said that Ethereum is a survivor. Major financial liquidations have wracked the Ethereum community before this month, and each time, Ethereum—not always gracefully—has emerged intact and continued on an upward price path. This historical responsiveness has some market participants obsolete with hope that Ethereum will surge again. Crypto Twitter and Speculation: Is It Too Soon to Write Off ETH? Observers of the turmoil possible in the markets take to social media to offer opinions and even comic relief. One seems to have gone too far when tweeting for crypto. Or maybe that is just part of the comic facade of being a crypto founder. At left, in a tweet that is supposedly humorous, a divine dog from heaven poses in an igloo, and a heavenly E.T. gives a thumbs down while presiding over the impending doom of Ethereum. Remembering that cryptocurrency markets, especially ETH, are driven by emotion and a combination of fear, greed, and speculative sentiment is crucial. Yes, the liquidation of large, nice round numbers, E, that could lead to downward pressure on: ETH. But hey, it’s far too early to pronounce the end of Ethereum’s growth. Other things are happening in the market besides the liquidation of these large positions: Ongoing enhancements, like the transition to Ethereum 2.0, ensure Ethereum’s evolution continues apace. Compared to the original Ethereum network, Ethereum 2.0 is forecasted to be far more scalable and far more energy-efficient. Indeed, many if not most developments in the blockchain world seem to suggest that the position of Ethereum in the broader ecosystem remains secure. The Key Question: Will Whales Step In to Buy the Dip? Is Ethereum on the brink of potential liquidation? Anyone’s mind could be filled with that question. Across the board, there’s a ton of spills and fills. And into these spilt and filled minds, the question of whether whales will step in to buy the dip and prevent a larger sell-off spills out. In past market downturns, whales are said to have been known to accumulate large amounts of ETH at lower price points, capitalizing on the opportunity to buy discounted assets. If the price of ETH continues to decline and hits the liquidation thresholds, might there be an influx from these major players into buying ETH? Could that buying pressure help stabilize the market and reverse the downward trend? Whales make up a large portion of the market for ETH. They buy up big amounts and in that way store or hold the asset. At least we think they do. Who are these whales? Some of them are early Ethereum investors and developers, some of whom receive millions in funding and also make use of Ethereum in their businesses. At least they did before the bear market hit. What will happen next in this situation is anything but certain, and the next few days will surely be of utmost importance in deciding which way ETH’s price will go. Although many still have faith in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory, the price dynamics in the short-term seem as if they could play a pivotal role in determining the immediate future of the asset. Conclusion: Is It Too Early to Panic? Although the possibility of liquidation exists, we cannot let this prospect overwhelm us. We must look at the situation in a calm and collected manner. Let us not forget that Ethereum has weathered storms before—dangerous storms—that were enough to sink other projects. And somehow, Ethereum always manages to come back. The question, then, is whether this price drop is something that is going to create a danger zone for us ETH holders, or if it is just another storm that will blow over. Liquidation is only one part of the story, and it is one that’s being told against a backdrop of adverse crypto market conditions. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

            "BODY": "April 2 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment in global trade policy. US President Donald Trump has dubbed it “Liberation Day,” in reference to when new tariffs — exceeding 20%— will hit imports from over 25 countries. According to The Wall Street Journal , the administration is also weighing “broader and higher tariffs” beyond this initial wave, meaning that April 2nd is unlikely to be the end of economic uncertainty. Markets reacted negatively over the past week, with the S&P 500 dropping 3.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 slid 5%, underscoring investor anxiety. At the same time, gold surged 4%, reaching a record high above $3,150 per ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.2%, even as recent inflation data showed an uptick in some of the core components. The markets’ is a classic sign of a risk-off environment—one that often precedes economic contraction. Throughout the volatility, Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped 6%—relatively modest compared to its historical volatility, but this does not make it a reliable hedge just yet, although its growing role as a reserve asset suggests this could shift over time. Bonds and gold lead the flight to safety In periods of macroeconomic and geopolitical instability, investors typically seek yield-bearing and historically stable assets. Both US government bonds’ decreasing yield and gold prices’ increase signal an increasing demand for these types of assets. Gold is having a standout moment. Over the past two months, gold funds have attracted more than $12 billion in net inflows, according to Bloomberg — marking the largest surge of capital into the asset since 2020. Gold funds monthly inflows. Source: Bloomberg Since the beginning of the year, gold prices have been up nearly +17%, while the S&P 500 has been down 5%. This shows a precarious state of the economy, further confirmed by a sharp drop in the US consumer sentiment , which has fallen around 20 points to reach levels not seen since 2008. In March, just 37.4% of Americans expected stock prices to rise over the next year—down nearly 10 points from February and 20 points below the peak in November 2024. As The Kobeissi Letter put it : “An economic slowdown has clearly begun.” Bitcoin: Digital gold or tech proxy? A Matrixport chart shows that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) is now 70% correlated with the Nasdaq 100—a level reached only twice before. This suggests that macro forces are still shaping Bitcoin's short-term moves, much like tech stocks. IBIT BTC ETF vs Nasdaq - 30-day correlation. Source: Matrixport The ETF data supports this trend. After a strong week of inflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net outflow of $93 million on March 28, according to CoinGlass . The total Bitcoin ETP assets under management have dropped to $114.5 billion, the lowest in 2025. The numbers show that Bitcoin is still perceived more as a speculative tech proxy and is yet to enter a new phase of market behavior. However, some signs of this potential transition are already apparent. Related: Worst Q1 for BTC price since 2018: 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week Bitcoin is on the path to becoming a reserve asset Beneath the volatility, a structural shift is underway. Companies are increasingly using Bitcoin and its ETFs to diversify their balance sheets. According to Tipranks , 80.8% of BlackRock’s IBIT shares are owned by public companies and individual investors. Furthermore, in Feb. 2025, BlackRock incorporated a 1% to 2% allocation of IBIT into its target allocation portfolios, reflecting growing institutional adoption. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that publicly listed companies currently hold 665,618 BTC, and private firms hold 424,130 BTC. Together, that’s 1,089,748 BTC — roughly 5.5% of the total supply (excluding lost coins). These figures underscore the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. What’s more, some experts predict that holding BTC in corporate treasury will become a standard practice by the end of the decade. Elliot Chun, a partner at the crypto-focused M&A firm Architect Partners, said in a March 28 blog post: “I anticipate that by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 will have BTC somewhere on their balance sheets as a long-term asset.” The character of any asset is defined by the attitude of those who own it. As more corporations adopt Bitcoin for treasury diversification—and as sovereign entities begin experimenting with Bitcoin reserves—the cryptocurrency's profile is shifting. The US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, as imperfect as it is, contributes to this trend. It’s too early to call Bitcoin a full-fledged hedge. Its price is still primarily driven by short-term speculation. But the transition is underway. As adoption grows across countries, companies, and individuals, Bitcoin’s volatility will likely decrease, and its utility as a partial hedge will increase. For now, the safe haven label may be aspirational. But if current trends continue, it might not be for long. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

            "BODY": "Toncoin price predictions as well as Litecoin updates are dominating market discussions today as many experts have highlighted them to experience wild swings. Toncoin has continued to expand its utility in the Telegram ecosystem while Litecoin maintains its status as a reliable altcoin. Remittix is disrupting the remittance industry through its presale that has encouraged investors to reconsider their portfolio holdings and watch out for assets for major market shifts. But what’s fueling Remittix’s presale momentum? Let us explore current market developments, expert opinions and essential factors which could trigger rapid token price growth for RTX, LTC and TON. Toncoin Price Prediction For April: Will TON Resist Bearish Sentiment? Toncoin's price of $3.78 is currently 23.95% off CoinCodex's target price of $4.96 on April 2, 2025, despite a 10.4% gain over the past month. Analysts offering Toncoin price predictions say Toncoin needs to break through its resistance barrier at $4.13 for analysts to consider the predicted 29.57% price increase. Many experts earlier this year projected a turbulent Toncoin price prediction journey through 2025 as their price forecasts saw Toncoin hitting lows of $3.38. According to some investors the highest Toncoin price predictions for the rest of 2025 now stands at $5 despite present market values but this prediction requires improvement on chain activity. To achieve success in the market, Toncoin needs effective utilization of its Ethereum-compatible ecosystem while avoiding any price drops below the significant $3.39 support level that researchers have identified. Litecoin Updates: Are Ecosystem Improvements Enough ForLTC To Hit $130 In April? Litecoin updates present a Defi coin at a crossroads. Changelly's prognosis for Litecoin paints an epic April as they expect LTC will soar 60.47% to $133 should it overcome the $91 resistance level. This is due to Litecoin's 1.58% monthly gain and classification as a top-20 cryptocurrency by market capitalization ($6.49 billion), which has spurred hopes of greater things to come. Litecoin updates on March 27 reveal that Litecoin network achieved a historic milestone when its hashrate exceeded 2.30 PH/s to become the highest figures in its existence. The surge reflects how miners contributed massive computing power which increased network protection while demonstrating strong belief in Litecoin's future direction. The recent increase in mining difficulty could result in a LTC price growth based on market sentiment that matches miners' bullish behavior even though the current market rate stands at under $90. Much like the 38.2% Fibonacci point of $132.23 that stands as a test for strength among bulls, Litecoin's fate is left in April's mood and institutional purchases. Remittix Is The Silent Disruptor in Cross-Border Payments Remittix has brought PayFi as its internal technology solution to perform crypto-to-fiat currency instant conversions for over 30 fiat currencies without requiring third-party providers like SWIFT. The AI-powered routing system in Remittix provides 70% lower transaction costs compared to current solutions and same-day settlements which makes it stand out better than Toncoin and Litecoin. The presale process supported by smart investors has resulted in the successful fundraising of more than $14.2 million and the sale of 524 million tokens. At the present time Remittix trades at $0.0734 and aims to reach $3.67 within Q2 2025 through top exchange listings. The token launch of RTX will purportedly achieve 800% growth because of restricted distribution alongside its staking mechanisms that analysts relate to Toncoin-like progress but accelerated through a compressed time period. Remittix operates as a DeFi company that prioritizes business-to-business integration through secure KYC/AML procedures to achieve an efficient DeFi-traditional finance gateway while competing against Toncoin and Litecoin. Get in now and don’t miss out on 2025’s 50x coin!

            "BODY": "Value doesn’t just come from code—it comes from belief. Bitcoin proved that trust could fuel an alternative financial system, while Ethena brought fresh thinking to how DeFi stable assets work. But beyond just charts or protocols, there’s a stronger momentum building—centered on real participation and connection. A digital project’s strength isn’t always in its tech—it’s in the people supporting it. That’s what sets BlockDAG (BDAG) apart. Now boasting a thriving group of more than 100,000 members, BlockDAG has sparked a movement rooted in shared goals. Raising $209.5 million and delivering 2,380% ROI since Batch 1, it’s not simply developing a system—it’s growing a shared identity. Bitcoin: The Starting Point of Digital Value Since launching in January 2009 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) introduced the world to decentralized currency. It was built to replace Fiat systems through a peer-to-peer method, using proof-of-work so miners could validate activity by solving math puzzles. At the start, it traded below a penny. Over time, it became a widely accepted store of value and inflation hedge. By November 2024, it peaked at $73,737. As of March 28, 2025, it holds at $68,504—a rise of around 685 million percent from its early days. For those who bought Bitcoin early and kept it, the payoff has been massive. Despite changes in regulation and sharp market swings, it remains the top crypto by market cap and continues to act as the central asset in many portfolios globally. Ethena: Changing the Way Stability Works in Web3 When Ethena arrived in early 2024, it brought a new take on stability in DeFi with USDe—a synthetic dollar not tied to fiat reserves. Instead of being backed by cash, it keeps its value steady through on-chain liquidity and delta-hedging. In just a few months, it drew strong attention, reaching over $2 billion in market cap within a year. Its native ENA token, which launched at around $0.18, has climbed to $1.02 by March 28, 2025—a jump of more than 466%. Beyond price gains, Ethena gives stakers actual returns through on-chain derivatives, making it useful and efficient. With open methods, fast-growing tools, and clear documentation, Ethena has become a leading name in DeFi for users who want a stablecoin model beyond fiat support.

            "BODY": "Are you navigating the volatile waters of the crypto market and wondering whether altcoins are poised to surge or if Bitcoin is still king? The answer might lie in a simple yet powerful metric: the Altcoin Season Index. Currently flashing a reading of 17, this index is signaling a clear message – we are firmly in Bitcoin Season. But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio and investment strategy? Let’s dive deep and decode this crucial indicator. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Compass The CoinMarketCap (CMC) Altcoin Season Index acts as a compass, guiding you through the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market. It’s designed to answer a fundamental question: Are altcoins outperforming Bitcoin, or is Bitcoin leading the charge? Here’s a breakdown of how this index works: Metric Foundation: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure representation of market sentiment towards true altcoins versus Bitcoin. Performance Window: It examines the performance of these cryptocurrencies over the past 90 days. This timeframe is crucial as it smooths out short-term volatility and reveals more significant trends. The 75% Threshold: The magic number is 75%. For the market to be officially declared in “Altcoin Season,” at least 75% of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Bitcoin Season Trigger: Conversely, when 75% or more of these top coins *fail* to outperform Bitcoin, we enter “Bitcoin Season.” This signifies Bitcoin’s dominance in market performance. Index Range: The Altcoin Season Index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger altcoin season, while a lower score, like the current 17, points towards Bitcoin’s prevailing strength. Decoding the Current Crypto Market: Why Bitcoin Season Reigns With the Altcoin Season Index currently at a low 17, the message is clear: Bitcoin is outperforming the vast majority of altcoins. This “Bitcoin Season” has several implications for the crypto market and your investment decisions. Factors Contributing to Bitcoin Dominance Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty or broader economic anxieties, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven within the crypto space. Bitcoin’s established history and larger market capitalization contribute to this perception. Institutional Interest: Major institutional investors are still more comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin compared to the more volatile and less understood altcoin market. Positive news or developments around institutional Bitcoin adoption can further strengthen Bitcoin’s position. Narrative Strength: Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” and a hedge against inflation often gains traction, especially during economic downturns or inflationary periods. This narrative can drive demand and price appreciation for Bitcoin. Altcoin Volatility: While altcoins offer the potential for higher percentage gains, they also come with significantly higher volatility and risk. During Bitcoin Season, this perceived higher risk can deter investors from altcoins, further consolidating capital in Bitcoin. Navigating Crypto Investment Strategies During Bitcoin Season So, what should be your crypto investment strategy during Bitcoin Season? Does it mean abandoning altcoins altogether? Not necessarily. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Your Altcoin Holdings This is a crucial time to reassess your altcoin portfolio. Identify altcoins that have strong fundamentals, active development teams, and real-world use cases. Focus on quality over quantity. Consider trimming positions in altcoins that are underperforming and lack strong catalysts for future growth. A deep dive into project roadmaps, tokenomics, and community sentiment is essential. Accumulate Bitcoin Strategically Bitcoin Season presents an opportunity to strategically accumulate more Bitcoin. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build your Bitcoin holdings over time, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value remains compelling, and Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to increase your exposure. Explore Select Altcoin Opportunities While it’s Bitcoin Season, select altcoins may still present compelling opportunities. Look for altcoins that are breaking away from the general market trend and showing relative strength. These could be projects with upcoming catalysts like major upgrades, partnerships, or mainnet launches. However, exercise caution and conduct thorough research before investing in altcoins during Bitcoin Season. Monitor the Altcoin Season Index Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index. A rising index suggests a potential shift towards Altcoin Season, indicating that altcoins are starting to gain momentum relative to Bitcoin. This could signal a change in market dynamics and potential opportunities in the altcoin market. Use the index as one of many tools in your crypto analysis toolkit. Diversification Remains Key Even during Bitcoin Season, diversification is crucial. While Bitcoin may be the dominant force, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes, including select altcoins, can help mitigate risk and capture potential upside when market conditions shift. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is Bitcoin. The Future of Crypto Market Cycles: Bitcoin and Beyond The crypto market is cyclical, and seasons change. Bitcoin Season, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index, highlights Bitcoin’s current dominance. However, history suggests that altcoins will have their time to shine again. Understanding these market cycles and utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index empowers you to make informed investment decisions and navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies effectively. The current reading of 17 on the Altcoin Season Index serves as a valuable insight, urging investors to acknowledge Bitcoin’s strength and adjust their strategies accordingly. By staying informed, adaptable, and strategic, you can position yourself to thrive regardless of whether it’s Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season.

            "BODY": "Chainlink price has sold off over the past three months, leading to a $10 billion wipeout as its market cap fell from $18 billion to $8.8 billion. Chainlink ( LINK ) crashed to $13.52 because of the ongoing sell-off in the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which sets the tone in crypto, dropped from $109,300 in January to $82,000. Still, LINK has several catalysts that could boost its price in the coming weeks. According to CoinMarketCap , it has a bullish community sentiment of 93.2%, indicating that many of CMC’s users remain optimistic about the coin. That score is significantly higher than Jupiter ( JUP ), which ranks second with a sentiment score of 88%. Chainlink has also continued to enhance its network in 2024. Developers recently announced the launch of Chainlink Payment Abstraction, a cross-chain-enabled payment system designed to reduce friction within the ecosystem.

The conversion is powered by Chainlink Automation, price feeds, and a decentralized exchange. Initially, this abstraction will focus on converting fees generated by the Chainlink Smart Value Recapture mechanism. Chainlink is also positioned to benefit from the growth of technologies like decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization. It has already established partnerships with major institutions such as Swift, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, Google, Oracle, BNY Mellon, and JPMorgan. Chainlink price technical analysis LINK price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the LINK price bottomed at $11.91 this month. Its lowest point this month was a crucial level since it coincided with its lowest swings since July 2023. Chainlink has formed a giant megaphone pattern, a common bullish formation. It has also reached a major support/resistance pivot on the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back and potentially retest the ultimate resistance point at $25, an 85% gain from current levels. However, a drop below the lower boundary of the megaphone at $11.90 would invalidate the bullish outlook. You might also like: HYPE price double bottoms as Hyperliquid volume plunges",

Discover BlockDAG’s keynote 3 highlights — Beta Testnet going live, confirmed audits and a $209.5m presale. Find out about Ethereum price testing resistance and Tether news signaling expansion. Table of Contents Can Ethereum break past the $2,050 hurdle? Tether news highlights €10m deal with ‘Be Water’ media BlockDAG’s keynote 3 sends a clear message: BDAG is built to thrive Final takeaways Ethereum has been grinding its way back after testing support near $1,980, and now the focus is on whether the Ethereum price can break through resistance at $2,050. As markets track that momentum, eyes are also on Tether news, where a €10 million investment in an Italian media group hints at a broader push beyond crypto infrastructure. But if there’s one project that made real progress this week, it is BlockDAG (BDAG). Keynote 3, released Friday, laid out clear evidence that the team is following through. The Beta Testnet is officially live: faster, upgraded, and already running dApps. On top of that, adoption numbers keep climbing, and the presale has pulled in over $209.5 million so far. For BDAG holders and watchers alike, the message was clear: progress isn’t being promised, it’s already happening. Can Ethereum break past the $2,050 hurdle? The Ethereum (ETH) price is attempting to recover after testing support near the $1,980 level. Although it briefly dipped below $2,000, it has since moved above that mark and is now trading just under $2,040. Resistance is building near $2,050 and $2,100, with a bearish trend line signaling potential challenges ahead. If momentum carries it past $2,100, the Ethereum price could target $2,150 or higher. On the downside, failure to clear resistance may lead to a pullback toward $1,980 or lower, with $1,920 and $1,880 acting as additional support zones in the short term. Tether news highlights €10m deal with ‘Be Water’ media In recent Tether news, the stablecoin issuer has confirmed a €10 million investment to acquire a 30% stake in the Italian media company ‘Be Water’. The deal includes indirect ownership of media outlets such as Chora Media, Will Media, and Be Water Film, which specialise in podcast and video content production. This move signals Tether’s intent to broaden its presence beyond digital assets, potentially increasing its influence within global media networks. As more Tether news develops around this investment, attention is likely to turn to how this media foothold aligns with the company’s wider strategic direction.

A major highlight came early with the announcement of Beta Testnet V1, now live and running at double the speed of the alpha version. Packed with upgrades like an enhanced explorer, a token and NFT creation wizard, and multiple functional dApps, the beta release marks a shift from testing theory to testing utility. Keynote speakers also detailed how BlockDAG’s unique architecture, powered by DAG structure and Proof-of-Work, supports high throughput by allowing multiple miners to validate simultaneously, solving congestion without compromising on decentralization. Security updates took center stage as well. The keynote confirmed successful audits from Halborn and CertiK, while outlining additional protections, including institutional-grade MPC fund custody and fault-tolerant systems designed to withstand attacks and downtime. As Chief Security Officer Youssef Khaoulaj put it, “Security extends far beyond just code, it’s about the people and processes that fuel our ecosystem.” Alongside these technical milestones, the keynote spotlighted growing user engagement: more than 800,000 users are mining through the X1 Miner App, 400,000+ on the Tap Miner game, and over 10,000 ASIC miners set to be shipped by the time mainnet goes live. The keynote’s biggest statement may have been in the numbers. So far, BlockDAG has raised $209.5 million through its presale, without a single venture capital firm. Over 19 billion BDAG coins have been sold, with the price climbing 2380% to $0.0248 in batch 27. The scale of growth has turned heads, placing BlockDAG among today’s top crypto gainers, and hinting at what could come next as the presale barrels toward its $600 million target. Final takeaways Ethereum is inching toward a key technical breakout, and if the Ethereum price clears resistance, a stronger move could follow. Meanwhile, Tether news is signaling a quiet pivot, its latest investment hints at ambitions that go well beyond stablecoins. But the real momentum play right now is BlockDAG. Keynote 3 didn’t just bring a live Beta Testnet, it rolled out confirmed audits, real-time user metrics, and a developer pipeline packed with grants, hackathons, and education tools. That level of delivery has sparked a sharp rise in demand, sending the presale to $209.5 million, and counting. At just $0.0248, BDAG still offers entry at a fraction of its projected value, and as analysts rank it among the top crypto gainers today, it’s quickly becoming the coin no one wants to miss.

            "BODY": "This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . In the realm of macro risks, this week is stacked with market-moving events — particularly relevant to risk assets. “Liberation Day” on Wednesday could trigger sweeping tariffs and exacerbate trade war fears, while Friday’s US jobs report will test the resilience of the labor market and offer clues into future Fed policy moves. Throw in Eurozone CPI, Fed Chair Powell’s post-jobs-report remarks, and a Congressional hearing on the future of stablecoins, and you have a volatile mix of economic, political and regulatory items converging at once. Oh, and don’t overlook Japan, where a new fiscal year on April 1 could trigger large-scale capital redeployment, notwithstanding headline-driven US tariff chatter. I’m tired, boss! DeFi, on the other hand, has its own set of risks to worry about. Navigating the part of the crypto game where risks are too often opaque and inconsistent leads the degens among us to simply ignore them. Yet, as protocols like Morpho scale into multi-billion dollar platforms, that problem compounds. The risks aren’t just about smart contracts anymore; they span asset types, market design and human factors like governance and custody. But things are improving. The latest tool in the toolbox is Credora’s recent launch of risk ratings for Morpho vaults. These aren’t merely marketing labels — they’re probabilistic, institutional-grade assessments that break down risk at the collateral, market and vault level. A vault rated A+ should be more than a vibe; it should be a signal derived from a consensus process involving crypto-native and traditional credit experts that simulate real-world defaults and loss probabilities. This move towards pushing risk transparency forward reminds me of other standout projects: Bluechip.org is one source for stablecoin analysis, providing transparent and curated risk profiles for fiat-backed and decentralized assets alike. Its community-first model prioritizes credibility over hype — though it’s hard to keep up with all the new launches these days. Serenity Research brings a similar rigor to stablecoin yield hunters. Its risk-adjusted yield rankings aim to standardize a discount rate for constructing risk-reward profiles. Risk curators like Gauntlet and Chaos Labs have spent years advising protocol governance on risk parameters using agent-based simulations. It’s critical work but advice that often stays inside governance forums or within core teams. What’s new here is the shift toward user-facing, accessible risk signals. A Credora score is an accessible way to help users understand and trade-offs. That opens the door to something bigger: risk-aware capital flows. Firms can build structured products with embedded risk scores. Wallets can surface safer options by default. Insurance markets can price policies with real inputs. Risk, in other words, becomes composable. DeFi players have spent years optimizing for yield. The next phase is about risk-adjusted yield — and how to verify it. By translating complexity into standardized, transparent metrics, we can set the stage for more intelligent capital allocation. The dream isn’t risk-free DeFi. It’s know-your-risk DeFi.

            "BODY": "Dogecoin may be heading for a short-term correction, with one expert predicting a dip to $0.60 before any major rally. While DOGE cools off, investor attention is turning to Remittix(RTX) , a rising star in crypto payments. With its record-breaking presale already surpassing $14.2 million, Remittix is gaining global momentum for offering real-world utility and fast crypto-to-fiat transfers. As hype around DOGE slows, RTX continues to draw serious interest from savvy investors worldwide. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Expert Predicts DOGE Pullback Ahead of 2025 Breakout Dogecoin may have big moves ahead, but one expert warns the road to new highs could start with a pullback. According to a revised analysis from Dogecapital , DOGE still follows its familiar four-year cycle, which saw explosive rallies in both 2017 and 2021. While some traders eye a potential surge to $11.71 by late 2025, the analyst believes a short-term dip to around $0.60 is likely before any major rally kicks off. Dogecoin is currently exiting what analysts call its “accumulation phase,” historically a prelude to massive breakouts. But before it mirrors the 37x moves seen in past cycles, it may need to flush out weak hands and consolidate. In the last two cycles, DOGE saw significant corrections before taking off, making a $0.60 retest a healthy reset, not a red flag. Adding to that, whales have been quietly accumulating , scooping up over 200 million DOGE as the Dogecoin price dropped from $0.22 to $0.15, signaling that big players are preparing for what’s next. April 2025 could still be the target date if Dogecoin’s timing history holds true, but traders are urged to watch the coming months closely. Until then, the sentiment remains cautious, with seasoned investors eyeing strategic entries rather than chasing green candles. Remittix Offers Instant Crypto to Fiat Transfers Without Hidden Fees Remittix is rapidly becoming the go-to token for investors seeking substance over sentiment. While DOGE thrives on cycles and community-driven rallies, Remittix is capturing serious attention for solving one of crypto’s most stubborn issues: real-world usability. The platform enables users to convert cryptocurrency into fiat and send it directly to any bank account in the world, instantly and without hidden costs. That’s a massive leap forward, especially in a financial environment where speed, privacy and affordability are more crucial than ever. Remittix is focused on function. It’s not a meme, and it’s not trying to be the next L1 blockchain. Instead, it serves as a powerful financial bridge connecting the decentralized power of crypto to the real-world banking infrastructure most people still rely on. Through a straightforward wallet connection, users choose a destination, select the amount and settle in local currency without fees. It’s simplicity and speed wrapped into a practical product and that’s precisely why investors are flocking in. Remittix Gains Global Publicity as Presale Raises Over $14.2 Million Confidence in Remittix continues to rise as investors recognize its long-term potential. At the time of writing, over 524 million tokens have been sold, raising a staggering $14.2 million in presale funding. The token's price has already climbed from its presale launch value of $0.015 to $0.0734 a 380% return for early adopters. But this isn't just a short-term spike. With more presale stages ahead and institutional attention growing, many believe RTX has the fundamentals to outpace even top-performing altcoins in 2025. Dogecoin’s future remains promising to many, especially if its historical four-year cycle plays out. Still, it may face a temporary correction before any parabolic move materializes. Meanwhile, Remittix is gathering momentum not through speculation, but through utility and that’s why it’s getting more publicity and investor interest worldwide. As DOGE prepares for a potential dip and a long-term breakout, Remittix continues to rise steadily, backed by real demand and a clear use case. For those watching where the smart money is going, the signals are loud and clear.

            "BODY": "Crypto investment products saw a strong recovery last week as the market recorded a whopping $226 million in inflows, according to CoinShares. This marked the ninth day of positive inflows into exchange-traded products (ETPs). The report, written by CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, suggested that while investors slowly return to crypto, they remain cautious. Altcoins See First Gains in Five Weeks The leading crypto asset, Bitcoin, recorded the biggest portion of the inflow, attracting $195 million in inflows. In contrast, short Bitcoin products, which bet that Bitcoin’s price will fall, saw $2.5 million in outflows. Notably, this is the fourth week in a row that investors have pulled back from bearish positions. For the first time in over a month, investors moved money back into altcoin ETPs, with total inflows reaching $33 million. Before this, investors had withdrawn $1.7 billion from altcoin products over four weeks. Ethereum (ETH) had the highest inflows among altcoins, gaining $14.5 million. Solana (SOL) followed with $7.8 million, while XRP and Sui recorded $4.8 million and $4 million, respectively. This suggests that while Bitcoin remains the top choice, some investors re-invest money in other major cryptocurrencies. Most Crypto Investment Products Came From the U.S. and Europe Most of the crypto investment product’s inflows came from major Western markets. The United States led with $204 million, followed by Switzerland with $14.7 million and Germany with $9.2 million. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Brazil saw minor outflows of $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, showing regional differences in investor sentiment. Despite the overall positive trend, ETPs saw $74 million in net outflows on Friday. CoinShares linked this to the release of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data which was higher than expected . The report suggests that inflation concerns could make the Federal Reserve maintain interest rates high, adding short-term uncertainty to the crypto market. A Cautious but Growing Optimism Among Crypto Investors While the recent investment inflows show growing confidence in the crypto market, Butterfill noted that investors remain careful due to uncertain macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin’s total assets under management (AUM) recently fell to $114 billion, the lowest since the U.S. election. This is because crypto trading volume has fallen by a massive 70% after surging after the November 2024 presidential elections. This shows how the market is adjusting to inflation risks while expecting economic growth and favorable regulatory policies. Overall, CoinShares’ report suggests that investors are returning to digital assets but are not aggressively rushing in. Investors are also focusing on Bitcoin and large-cap altcoins, while concerns about inflation and interest rates continue to influence decisions.

            "BODY": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is advocating for U.S. regulations to permit consumers to earn interest on stablecoins. Armstrong argued in an X post that allowing stablecoin interest would benefit consumers, expand financial access globally, and strengthen the U.S. economy. He explained that stablecoins are typically backed 1:1 by the dollar and held in low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries. The interest from these reserves is usually retained by issuers rather than passed on to consumers.

He also emphasized that billions globally remain underbanked and could benefit from access to interest-earning U.S. dollars via stablecoins. Additionally, he noted that stablecoins are among the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries, reinforcing dollar dominance. Armstrong stated that regulatory barriers prevent stablecoins from offering interest in the same way banks do. He called on lawmakers to address this in upcoming stablecoin legislation , arguing that a free-market approach would benefit consumers and keep innovation within the U.S. “So why aren’t we doing this today?” Armstrong questioned. “The tech is all there, but the law hasn’t caught up.” You might also like: Circle planning to launch IPO in late April: report",

            "BODY": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is at a critical inflection point, with traders eyeing key support and resistance levels that could dictate its next big move. DOGE is trading at approximately $0.163, having faced a recent 16% pullback after failing to surpass the $0.198 resistance zone. With momentum shifting, the coming days could define DOGE’s trajectory. Market Overview and Price Action Currently, DOGE is hovering around the $0.160 support level, a crucial price zone that could determine its short-term direction . A strong defense of this level could lead to a rebound toward resistance at $0.177 and $0.185. However, a breakdown below $0.160 might open the door for a deeper correction to the $0.150 support level. Bullish vs. Bearish Outlook Bullish Momentum Potential Should DOGE hold firm above $0.160 and successfully push past $0.177, bullish momentum could accelerate. A break beyond $0.185 would be significant, potentially setting the stage for a run toward the psychological resistance of $0.200. If Doge sustained demand and increased utility, DOGE could experience long-term growth with targets extending to $7. Downside Risks If DOGE loses the $0.160 support, the next key level to watch is $0.150. A failure to hold this zone could invite further selling pressure, possibly leading to a prolonged consolidation or even a deeper retracement. Such a scenario might delay any strong upward movement in the near term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Catalysts to Watch DOGE’s price movement will largely depend on broader market sentiment, regulatory shifts, and its growing use as a payment method. Elon Musk’s continued interest and potential integration of DOGE into his business ecosystem could serve as a major catalyst for a price surge. With DOGE trading near crucial price levels, traders and investors should stay alert. A breakout above resistance could spark a rally, while a dip below support may trigger further downside. As always, careful risk management and thorough market analysis are essential before making trading decisions.

            "BODY": "Binance, the planet’s biggest crypto exchange by volume, has released a new feature bridging its services to the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. In a new announcement , Binance says it’s introducing CEX to DEX (centralized exchange to decentralized exchange) trading, a new feature that enables users to trade tokens through their wallets using their Binance CEX funds. According to the company, Binance users can now directly trade on-chain through the Binance Wallet tab with their spot or funding account balances using stablecoins to access tokens trading on decentralized exchanges via the Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Base and BNB Smart Chain networks. “This feature bridges the gap between centralized and decentralized trading, providing Binance users with a more seamless way to purchase tokens on-chain.” The new feature comes as Binance CEO Richard Teng recently revealed what he thinks are the factors that could catalyze the mass adoption of crypto assets. In a recent interview with crypto personality Scott Melker, Teng said that crypto needs the support of regulators and institutions. “Firstly, you need more regulatory clarity. Because for the early adopters, people are embracing it without clarity. But for mass adoption to come through, they need to understand that the regulators are looking into this space, they feel adequately protected for mass adoption to come through. Secondly, you need institutions. Because without institutions, if it’s mainly retail play, the price action is going to be extremely volatile. So with more institutions, with more buy-and-hold users, and investors with a different time horizon, then the price movement will become much less volatile and the market cap will become much bigger over time.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "BODY": "A well-known market analyst, Edoardo Farina, has emphasized the effectiveness of the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy in accumulating wealth through XRP investments. Farina, who has consistently advocated for this approach , recently shared insights into how it contributed to his financial success over the past five years. Farina Highlights the Benefits of XRP DCA Farina revealed that he built his wealth by purchasing small amounts of XRP daily for five years. He believes this method allows investors to benefit from long-term market trends without being overly affected by short-term price fluctuations. Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves consistently buying a fixed amount of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This approach reduces the risk associated with market volatility and prevents investors from making poor timing decisions. For instance, if an investor commits to purchasing 100 XRP every week for a year, they continue this practice whether the price is $0.50 or $2.00. Farina has actively promoted this strategy as an effective way to accumulate XRP, which he views as a stronger investment option than Bitcoin. “DCA is the cheat code nobody talks about,” he remarked, reinforcing his confidence in the approach. Comparing XRP and Bitcoin Investment Returns Recent data suggests that a dollar-cost averaging strategy focused on XRP could have generated significantly higher profits than Bitcoin. Analysis suggests that if MicroStrategy had implemented a DCA approach with XRP instead of Bitcoin, the company might have accrued an additional $60 billion in profits. Farina also provided an example from his personal investment history to support his argument. In January 2021, he exchanged 0.33 BTC—then valued at €8,618—for 45,425 XRP. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at €26,115, while XRP was priced at €0.19. As of now, with the token valued at €2.18, his 45,425 XRP holdings are worth approximately €99,026. Had he chosen to keep his Bitcoin instead, his investment would be worth only €27,450 based on Bitcoin’s current price of $83,183. This comparison highlights the potential gains available to investors, particularly those using a disciplined DCA approach.

Notably, the asset gained significant value after Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024. While the broader crypto market also experienced an uptrend, XRP outperformed Bitcoin and several other major cryptocurrencies. Since November 2024, the token has appreciated by 284% against BTC and has continued to rise by 10.26% this month despite ongoing market uncertainties. Farina believes that the token’s strong performance over the past five years is an indication that a similar trend could continue. He suggests that investors who adopt a consistent DCA strategy now may benefit significantly in the future. While market conditions remain unpredictable, Farina’s experience underscores the potential advantages of steady, long-term investments in XRP. His case study serves as an example of how strategic accumulation can yield substantial returns over time. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

            "BODY": "In a strategic move that signals a significant shift in the crypto landscape, AhnLab Blockchain Company (ABC), a subsidiary of the renowned South Korean cybersecurity firm AhnLab, has announced its acquisition of Klip, the popular crypto wallet service developed by GroundX, the blockchain arm of Kakao. For those unfamiliar, Kakao is the powerhouse behind South Korea’s dominant messaging application. This acquisition is more than just a business deal; it’s a bold step towards integrating robust security with user-friendly crypto wallet technology. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of digital asset management and what users can expect. What Does AhnLab’s Acquisition of Klip Mean for the Crypto Wallet Market? This acquisition is poised to reshape the dynamics of the crypto wallet market, especially in South Korea. AhnLab, a leader in cybersecurity, bringing Klip, a well-established crypto wallet , under its wing creates a powerful synergy. Here’s a breakdown of what the deal entails: Complete Service Transfer: The agreement involves a full transfer of all services related to Klip from GroundX to ABC. This includes the Klaytn API Service (KAS), a critical piece of infrastructure, ensuring seamless integration and operation. Technological Infrastructure and Support: ABC is also inheriting the entire technological backbone of Klip, along with its customer support systems. This suggests a commitment to maintaining and enhancing the existing Klip user experience while leveraging AhnLab’s expertise. Integration with ABC Wallet: Looking ahead, ABC plans to merge Klip with its own wallet platform, ABC Wallet. This integration aims to create a unified, more powerful, and secure wallet solution for users. This move is significant because it marries the user-friendliness and market presence of Klip with AhnLab’s cybersecurity prowess. In a space where security breaches and wallet hacks are constant concerns, this acquisition could set a new standard for secure crypto wallet solutions. Why is AhnLab Making a Play in the Blockchain and Crypto Wallet Space? AhnLab’s foray deeper into the blockchain and crypto wallet domain is a calculated move, reflecting the growing convergence of cybersecurity and digital assets. But why now? And why Klip? Strategic Diversification: Cybersecurity firms are increasingly recognizing the importance of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Acquisition like this allows AhnLab to diversify its portfolio and tap into the burgeoning crypto market. Leveraging Expertise: AhnLab’s core strength is cybersecurity. Applying this expertise to the crypto space, particularly to crypto wallet security, is a natural and strategic extension of their business. Market Opportunity: The cryptocurrency market is maturing, and user demand for secure and reliable wallet solutions is on the rise. By acquiring Klip, AhnLab is seizing a significant market opportunity. Klip’s User Base: Klip isn’t just any wallet; it’s associated with Kakao, giving it a substantial existing user base in South Korea. This provides AhnLab with a ready-made market entry point. In essence, AhnLab isn’t just buying a crypto wallet ; they are investing in the future of secure digital asset management. They are strategically positioning themselves to be a key player in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. What Benefits Will Users See from the Klip Acquisition? For users of both Klip and ABC Wallet, and indeed for the broader crypto wallet community, this acquisition holds several potential benefits: Benefit Description Enhanced Security AhnLab’s cybersecurity expertise promises to bolster the security of the integrated wallet, potentially reducing vulnerabilities and protecting user assets.

Ultimately, the goal is to provide a more secure, user-friendly, and comprehensive crypto wallet experience. While the immediate changes might be behind the scenes, the long-term vision points towards a significant upgrade in the quality and security of digital asset management. Are There Any Challenges in Integrating Klip into ABC Wallet? While the acquisition is promising, integrating two complex systems like Klip and ABC Wallet is not without its challenges. Here are some potential hurdles: Technical Integration Complexity: Merging different technological infrastructures can be intricate. Ensuring seamless compatibility and data migration is crucial. User Experience Consistency: Maintaining a consistent and positive user experience across both platforms during and after integration is vital. Users should not feel disruptions or confusion. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea and globally will be an ongoing challenge. Market Competition: The crypto wallet market is competitive. AhnLab needs to ensure the integrated wallet stands out and attracts users amidst strong competition. However, given AhnLab’s resources and expertise, and the established foundation of Klip, these challenges are likely to be manageable. The focus will be on strategic planning and execution to ensure a smooth and successful integration. Looking Ahead: The Future of AhnLab’s Crypto Wallet Venture The acquisition of Klip by AhnLab is a strong indicator of the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing importance of security in the digital asset space. This move is not just about expanding market share; it’s about building a more secure and reliable future for crypto wallet users. By combining AhnLab’s cybersecurity leadership with Klip’s user-centric design and market presence, the integrated ABC Wallet has the potential to become a leading force in the blockchain wallet sector.

            "BODY": "Ripple’s (XRP) latest news shows that there is a growing volatility in the market. However, institutional interest and ETF speculation have continued to signal hopes of a rebound for the token. Meanwhile, Panshibi is gradually coming up as a star in the crypto industry, merging Asia, pandas, and meme coins into a special ecosystem. $SHIBI, the native token of the project, offers users profits of up to 1,200% APY on staking, adding it to the VIP perks it offers. As Ripple investors continue to look for new opportunities, the rise in the presale figures of Panshibi is catching their attention. Ripple Latest News: Can Ripple Overcome Market Volatility and ETF Speculation? Ripple has been performing poorly over the last few months amidst concerns from its investors over the volatility in the market. In addition, the project is burdened by inflation concerns and Federal Reserve policies, factors that are also affecting the wider market. Data has shown that rate cuts are still paused due to the rise in inflation rates that have exceeded expectations, driving investors away from risky assets. Recently, Ripple experienced a big drop that drove its token to $2.14. Despite the fall, Ripple latest news shows that institutional interest and regulatory clarity could be the fuel for a rebound. As Ripple fights to overcome these challenges, technical indicators also show that the token is at a critical period that could make or break the asset. If Ripple fails to return to $2.31, the asset could witness a further drop to $1.967 and even $1.356. Whales Shift Focus as XRP Investors Eye Panshibi (SHIBI) for Massive April Surge Panshibi ($SHIBI) has been catching the attention of traders in the crypto industry, merging three communities – Asia, pandas, and memecoins – into one interesting project. Drawing inspiration from the panda, the meme coin wants to change the space with social-fi and AI-driven tasks, which will allow users to earn rewards. With the $SHIBI native token, investors will be able to accuse profits from staking options and exclusive VIP perks, putting the project in a position to break out in 2025. As institutional and retail traders continue to look for the next big star in the market, Panshibi’s presale is seeing attention, having already $1.28 million of its $10 million goal. Excitement around the token has also increased, with experts predicting a 1,200% rise during the presale, and a 145,000% increase after it launches. The team has also noted that its liquidity pools will be locked for 10 years, with team allocation locked for two years, showing commitment to long-term stability and investor confidence. The project has also been audited by Coinsult, showing Panshibi’s mission concerning transparency and security. The project also plans to list SHIBI on top exchanges and Uniswap, showcasing its status as a rising star in the meme coin sector. XRP investors are taking notice, market watchers are predicting a rise in April, making Panshibi the next big success story in the market. XRP Funds Flow Into Panshibi (SHIBI) – The April Explosion You Can’t Miss! Ripple latest news highlights growing concerns in the project, while institutional interest remains, fueling speculations of a big rise. With key support levels broken, investors are looking to move funds away from Ripple, with Panshibi (SHIBI) emerging at the right time as a top choice. Analysts have also predicted a rise in April as XRP funds continue to move into this new player. Panshibi is catching the attention with its profits on staking and VIP perks for traders involved in its presale. Early investors can also enjoy gains with $SHIBI, with the token poised for a big jump. As momentum continues to build, this is the perfect time for traders to get in before it sees its big break!

            "BODY": "The post Where to Buy Influencer Pepe Before It Hits Major Exchanges! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new meme coin that is gaining significant attention in the cryptocurrency market is Influencer Pepe (INPEPE). Unlike typical Pepe imitations, this is the first digital currency specifically designed for the influencer sector, a powerhouse expected to soar to $48 billion by 2027. With major social media stars on platforms like X, TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram already talking about it, INPEPE presents a unique opportunity to be part of a cultural and financial transformation from the very beginning. Launching at an astonishing presale price of only $0.0000001772, this token has the potential to become the next major player—and you can still invest before it becomes widely recognized. The INPEPE Buzz: Why It’s a Big Deal Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) isn’t just another meme coin hopping on the Pepe bandwagon—it’s staking a claim as the first cryptocurrency tailored for the influencer industry, a sector projected to balloon to $48 billion by 2027 from $25 billion in 2025. That explosive growth over two years signals a massive opportunity, and INPEPE’s first-mover advantage could be its golden ticket. No other crypto has targeted this niche, leaving INPEPE poised to capture a flood of creators and fans looking for a seamless, crypto-native way to transact in an industry driven by social media clout. With influencers already teasing their involvement on social platforms, INPEPE could ride this wave to become the de facto currency for a market that’s only getting bigger—think of it as the crypto spark igniting a $48 billion fire. If it locks in early adoption, the potential for a price boom is staggering, turning its presale price of $0.000000172 into a distant memory. Beyond sheer market size, INPEPE could revolutionize the influencer space by bridging the gap between traditional monetization and blockchain innovation. Imagine a world where TikTok stars accept INPEPE tips during live streams, Instagram influencers sell exclusive posts for tokens, or YouTube creators fund projects via INPEPE-backed campaigns—all without the clunky fees of fiat systems. This isn’t just convenience; it’s a paradigm shift, giving influencers a direct, decentralized way to monetize their influence while rewarding fans with a stake in the ecosystem. Your Exclusive Window: The Presale Scoop Forget waiting for centralized exchanges—INPEPE is only available through a presale widget embedded on its official site. No DEX detours, no third-party swaps—just straight-to-the-source action. You’ve got four payment options: ETH, USDT, BNB, or a bank card. That’s right—even if you’re crypto-shy, you can jump in with plastic. But don’t sleep on it—each presale stage jacks up the price, and the early bird gets the fattest worm. Here’s how to lock in your stash before the big leagues get their hands on it. How to Buy INPEPE Right Now Ready to hop on the Influencer Pepe train? Follow these steps, and move fast—stages sell out, and prices won’t wait. Gear Up with a Wallet (or Not): If you’re paying with ETH, USDT, or BNB, grab a wallet like Best Wallet (free, 4.6+ stars on iOS/Android) or MetaMask. Set it up with two-factor authentication and stash your keyphrase somewhere safe. Using a bank card? Skip this—card buys are wallet-free and lightning-fast. Load Your Ammo: For crypto, buy ETH, USDT, or BNB on an exchange like Binance or via Best Wallet’s ‘Buy’ feature. Card users, just have your digits ready—INPEPE’s widget handles the rest. Speed matters; the presale’s rolling! Hit the Website: Go to the project’s website and find the presale widget . It’s your only gate to INPEPE—no other platforms, no excuses. Buy Before It’s Gone: Pick your payment—crypto or card. For crypto, connect your wallet (authorize it quick), enter your amount, and check the INPEPE haul (gas fees apply). For cards, punch in your info. Hit ‘Buy INPEPE,’ confirm, and boom—you’re in. Prices rise next stage, so don’t dawdle! Why Buy Before the Exchanges? Getting INPEPE now isn’t just about bragging rights—it’s about stacking the odds. Presales are where meme coin legends are born. Take PEPE: it soared 430,000% from launch to peak in 2023. Post-launch, influencer hype might just lead to a 25x pop for the INPEPE price. Wait for exchanges, and you’re paying FOMO prices with the latecomers. What Influences the Price of Influencer Pepe? Influencer Industry Boom: $48 billion by 2027 means more creators, more INPEPE demand—huge upside awaits. Influencer Adoption: Top creators using INPEPE could 1,000X its value; inaction risks a stall. Crypto Market Trends: Bull runs lift meme coins—2025 could be massive. Staking Power: 20853% APY shrinks supply, driving gains for early stakers. Competition: First-mover status helps, but rivals could challenge—INPEPE’s lead matters. Advantages Driving INPEPE’s Potential First-Mover Edge: No crypto owns the influencer space—INPEPE’s pioneering a $48 billion niche. Influencer Reach: Social media stars with millions of followers can ignite viral growth—unmatched scale. Real Utility: Ties to a booming industry give it purpose beyond hype—think payments and tipping. Staking Boost: 20853% APY locks in holders, fueling scarcity and value—act now to maximize it. The Influencer Edge: What’s Driving It? INPEPE’s secret sauce? Influencers who move markets and unmatched utility. Imagine a post from a crypto king with 2 million followers—or a TikTok dance featuring Pepe that goes viral. If they deliver, INPEPE could dwarf its meme coin cousins. But it’s not guaranteed—hype can fade. This is why the team has included high levels of utility in the project. Right now, the presale’s your chance to ride the wave before it crests. Post-presale, INPEPE’s eyeing major exchange listings in 2025. A Binance debut could spike it 30–50%, per past meme coin patterns. Act Now or Kick Yourself Later Influencer Pepe (INPEPE) is a presale gem you won’t find anywhere but its website. With ETH, USDT, BNB, or a bank card, you’re seconds away from owning a piece of the next meme coin rocket. But the price ticks up with every stage—miss this, and you’re buying higher when the influencers ignite the fuse. Visit the Influencer Pepe website.

            "BODY": "Sui (SUI) and Kaspa (KAS) appear poised for significant movement. Emerging fractal patterns suggest potential breakouts. These indicators have captured attention and hint at a possible rally ahead. This analysis dives into whether these coins are set to rise. SUI Market Snapshot: Short-Term Downturn Amid Longer-Term Gains Price dropped by 22.03% during the last month while showing a 25.49% gain over the last six months. The recent monthly decline suggests short-term weakness, but the six-month recovery indicates an underlying resilience. The coin’s historical performance shows periods of volatility where initial losses were later overcome, reflecting shifting investor sentiment and market readjustment. SUI currently trades between $2.11 and $3.83 with immediate resistance at $4.84 and support at $1.40. Momentum figures and an RSI near 41.83 hint at bearish pressure in the short term, with no clear trend at present. Trading ideas focus on monitoring these levels for potential breakouts above resistance or tests of support for reversals. Kaspa Market Recap: Bearish Trends and Key Support/Resistance Levels Kaspa registered a steady decline over the past month and six-month period. The one-month price change of roughly 20.89% and a one-week drop of about 22.14% illustrate recent pressure, while the half-year decline of nearly 58.36% shows long-term struggles. Price performance during these periods highlights ongoing bearish sentiment and volatility, reflecting challenges in sustaining upward momentum. Kaspa currently trades between $0.06 and $0.12. The nearest resistance sits at $0.15 with a second hurdle at $0.21, while support is found around $0.04 with a theoretical base at zero. Indicators such as the RSI at 33 and negative oscillator signals point to bear dominance. A range-bound trading approach could involve watching for potential rebounds near support or breakouts above resistance. Conclusion SUI and KAS are showing signs of a potential breakout. Fractal patterns indicate that these coins might experience significant upward movement. Investors are advised to watch these patterns closely as they could signal upcoming rallies. The market dynamics support the possibility of substantial gains for SUI and KAS in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

            "BODY": "The market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) is growing by the day, but contrary to belief, the biggest hurdle to broader adoption isn’t regulation, but a lack of dedicated secondary markets for buying and selling tokenized securities, according to Prometheum founder and co-CEO Aaron Kaplan. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Kaplan drew attention to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood’s recent appearance at the Digital Asset Summit in New York, where she said that a lack of regulatory clarity is preventing her company from tokenizing its funds. “Contrary to popular belief, however, the hurdle isn’t ambiguous regulation,” said Kaplan, who noted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) special purpose broker-dealer framework and Alternative Trading System (ATS) licensing “already provide a regulated pathway for issuing blockchain-native funds that offer efficiency advantages over traditional issuances.” “The real bottleneck lies in the limited market infrastructure for delivering tokenized securities trading to a broad investor base,” he said. Excluding stablecoins, the value of tokenized RWAs has increased by nearly 8% to $19.5 billion over the past 30 days, according to industry data. Private credit and US Treasury debt remain the two largest use cases. The value of tokenized RWAs has grown rapidly over the past year. Source: RWA.xyz “These assets currently sit on a handful of blockchains, but there is still no fully public secondary market where institutional and retail investors can buy, sell, and trade them, as they do with traditional securities on Nasdaq or through a brokerage account like Fidelity,” said Kaplan, who identified two general approaches for building out these platforms. The first is building tokenized securities markets using decentralized finance (DeFi) frameworks, much like what Ondo Finance, Ethena Labs and Securitize are doing. Related: Ethena Labs, Securitize launch blockchain for DeFi and tokenized assets The second approach involves integrating tokenization protocols into existing brokerage platforms that operate under SEC-registered entities and are subject to federal securities laws. “Legacy crypto and fintech platforms are already accustomed to facilitating cryptocurrency trading, so you would expect them to seek to broaden their offerings to include tokenized securities,” said Kaplan. While many in the latter camp do not operate digitally, they “won’t cede market share without a fight,” said Kaplan. “Many are already investing in their own tokenization initiatives, or partnering with fintech and crypto firms, to remain competitive.” “What’s at stake is the next wave of users onboarding into the digital asset space [...] The question is then, will the brokerage industry enter the digital asset space, or will crypto platforms build the next gen markets for investors to buy and sell digital securities?” As a digital asset trading and custody firm, Prometheum is attempting to bridge the infrastructure gap by building a full-service digital asset securities marketplace. The company claims that securities traded on Prometheum have reduced fees, faster settlement times and increased efficiency. Related: CME Group taps Google Cloud for pilot asset tokenization program Investors want “digital native” versions of assets they’ve always known Perhaps the biggest demand driver for tokenized assets among traditional investors is that they want to access “digital native versions of all assets, in addition to crypto tokens, through a single ecosystem they are comfortably using [...] to meet a range of financial goals,” said Kaplan. One area where tokenization appears to be gaining traction is in real estate. As Cointelegraph recently reported, luxury and commercial properties are being tokenized all over North America and secondary markets are being established to enable the trading of tokenized shares. A 2024 report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) called tokenization a “game-changing blockchain use case in financial services” due to its scalability and near-instant transactions. According to BCG managing director and senior partner Sean Park, tokenization could boost investors’ annual returns by roughly $100 billion while increasing the revenue streams of financial institutions. Tokenized RWAs as an investable asset class reached an “inflection point” in 2023. Source: Boston Consulting Group The potential of tokenization has even been flagged by the World Economic Forum in a recent article published by Digital Asset co-founder and CEO Yuvan Rooz. In the article, Rooz showed that roughly 10% of the $230 trillion global securities market is eligible for use as collateral. “Tokenization, which improves collateral mobility and capital efficiency, could unlock this untapped capital and optimize intraday liquidity so that funds can be accessed and moved within the same trading day to meet payment and settlement obligations,” said Rooz.

            "BODY": "A prominent market expert has shared what he believes is the timeline for XRP to claim an ambitious two-digit price target. With XRP following the direction of the broader crypto market, the altcoin is on the verge of recording a second consecutive monthly loss for the first time since December 2022, during the bear market.Currently, XRP is down 3.16% in March 2025, with a day left to close the month. This follows a previous 29.33% crash in February, which saw it lose the $3 psychological mark. Amid this bearish atmosphere, analysts like EGRAG Crypto believe a recovery could be in the works soon. Timeline for XRP to Reach $27In his latest disclosure , the market watcher highlighted XRP's historical data, suggesting they could provide pointers for when XRP could reach his ambitious two-digit targets. It bears mentioning that EGRAG has always projected that XRP could reach $27 in the future.This time, the market analyst has identified a timeline for this target to materialize. According to his latest analysis, XRP could hit the $27 price in the next 63 days, essentially two months. To back up his prediction, he spotlighted XRP's behavior during the 2017 bull run, which resembles the price action in the ongoing bull market.Particularly, XRP first soared to an initial peak of $0.3988 in May 2017 before facing a massive roadblock and correcting. Despite the correction, it maintained most of the gains from the initial rally. It hit a low of $0.1891 in early November 2017 and then consolidated for another six weeks or 42 days before seeing a breakout. XRP 1W Chart | EGRAG Crypto This breakout led to a massive rally that persisted for three more weeks or 21 days, with XRP eventually hitting the $3.8 peak in January 2018. Essentially, XRP spent nine weeks or 63 days from when it hit the $0.1891 low to when it claimed the all-time high of $3.8.EGRAG expects this timeline to play out again. With XRP having reached a floor of $2 this week, the analyst believes it would take exactly 9 weeks or 63 days for the token to reach its new cycle peak of $27. This places the timeline in June 2025.EGRAG Maintains the XRP to $27 TargetFor context, the $27 price represents XRP's 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which EGRAG believes is its ultimate target for the cycle. During the 2017 rally, XRP claimed the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, which stood around the $3.3 price at the time. As a result, EGRAG has always championed this $27 price. For instance, as early as February 2024, The Crypto Basic reported that he predicted an XRP rally to $27. Interestingly, the asset traded for $0.54 at the time, suggesting that a run to $27 would demand a 4,900% from the prevalent price then.A month later, in March 2024, as XRP maintained the $0.5 level, EGRAG boldly claimed that the $27 price target remained unchanged. According to him, XRP was following its 2017 fractal. In February 2025, he again suggested XRP could rise to $27, citing a retest of the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB). Also, earlier this month, EGRAG predicted an XRP price spike to $27, calling attention to what he called the Kangaroo Phase. With XRP now trading for $2.09 at press time, the asset must rise 1,191% to $27, a massive improvement from the 4,900% demand a year ago.",

            "BODY": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at a decisive juncture, trading around $0.00001231 after a minor dip of 0.01677%. With price action tightening , a breakout looms as traders eye critical support and resistance levels. The market is showing signs of growing momentum. 4-Hour Chart: Breakout Loading The 4-hour chart reveals SHIB forming a descending wedge, often a precursor to a bullish breakout. A push past $0.000021 could trigger momentum toward $0.000025, attracting fresh buying interest. However, if resistance holds firm, SHIB may retest the $0.00001369 support zone. A break below this level could weaken bullish sentiment and lead to extended consolidation or a downward move. 1-Hour Chart: Consolidation Before the Storm SHIB remains range-bound on the 1-hour chart , reflecting market indecision. Despite minor fluctuations, the token has held key support levels, indicating that bulls are still in the game. A move above $0.00001260 could signal an uptrend, confirming bullish strength. Conversely, a drop below $0.00001200 might invite increased selling pressure and open the door for further declines. 15-Minute Chart: Immediate Volatility Signals Short-term action highlights resistance at $0.00001260 and support at $0.00001200. These levels serve as immediate barriers determining SHIB’s next move. A breakout could set the tone for the next leg, potentially confirming a bullish trend. However, failure to hold support could trigger a sharper retracement, leading to a more bearish outlook. What’s Next? Bullish Case: Clearing $0.00001260 could drive SHIB toward $0.000021, with further upside possible if volume surges. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Case: Losing $0.00001200 may increase sell pressure, pushing SHIB toward $0.00001199 or lower, potentially delaying any recovery attempts. SHIB is at a tipping point, with critical price levels acting as make-or-break zones. A decisive breakout could define the next trend, making this a crucial moment for traders. Given the market’s volatility, staying alert and watching key signals is essential for those looking to capitalize on SHIB’s next move.

            "BODY": "The Hyperliquid token dropped to a crucial support level as volume on its perpetual decentralized trading platform slumped. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) dropped to a low of $12.10, a notable level since it was its lowest level on March 13. Its market cap has dropped from over $9.7 billion in December to $4.43 billion. DeFi Llama data shows that the volume of cryptocurrencies traded on its network declined again in March. It handled over $159 billion in volume, down from $187 billion in February and $197 billion in January. Hyperliquid has now processed a cumulative volume of $1.16 trillion, making it the largest perpetual futures exchange in the industry. Jupiter ( JUP ), its biggest competitor, has handled $268 billion in cumulative volume. The total volume of assets traded across all decentralized perpetual futures platforms also declined in March. They processed over $275 billion in assets, down from $367 billion in January. A similar trend occurred in the spot market, where all DEX networks handled $243 billion, compared to $564 billion in January.

Historically, the volume handled in centralized and decentralized exchanges drop when crypto prices are diving. HYPE’s price also dropped amid criticism over how it handled Jelly, a new meme coin. A trader opened two long positions on JELLY worth about $4.1 million, then placed an additional $4.1 million short position against those longs. These trades pushed JELLY’s price up by 400%, resulting in a major loss for the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault. Hyperliquid later delisted the token, triggering backlash from the community. The platform has since pledged to compensate the affected users. After evidence of suspicious market activity, the validator set convened and voted to delist JELLY perps. All users apart from flagged addresses will be made whole from the Hyper Foundation. This will be done automatically in the coming days based on onchain data. There is no… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 26, 2025 HYPE price technical analysis Hyperliquid price chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that HYPE dropped and bottomed at $12.11 on Monday. This level is significant as it matches the lowest swing on March 13, forming a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $17.26, its highest point on March 24. A double bottom is a common bullish reversal signal. The two lines of the MACD have formed a bullish crossover, while the BBTrend indicator dropped to minus 25.13. BBTrend measures the spread between the outer lines of the Bollinger Bands indicator. Therefore, the Hyperliquid price will likely bounce back, and possibly hit the resistance point at $17.26, which is about 31% above the current level. A drop below the double-bottom level will point to more downside. You might also like: Hyperliquid implements security upgrades following JELLY liquidation incident",

            "BODY": "The post Bitcoin (BTC) Drops Toward Range Lows While Whales Accumulate a New Token Priced at $0.025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin hovers near its recent range lows, a quiet shift is taking place in the background. BTC’s pullback toward the $83K zone has caught the attention of many, especially as new macroeconomic data and upcoming tariffs keep the broader market on edge. However, behind the scenes, wallet data and trading behavior suggest that large-scale investors—commonly referred to as whales—aren’t standing still. These whales are still accumulating Bitcoin, but they’re also moving capital into newer, lower-cap opportunities. One token, currently priced at just $0.025, has started drawing serious attention: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Whales Diversify Beyond BTC As the crypto market enters a more cautious phase, the behavior of large holders becomes even more relevant. With BTC showing signs of weakness and potential downside volatility, capital rotation is in motion. Whales are now targeting early-stage tokens with strong fundamentals and long-term growth models—precisely the attributes that Mutuum Finance has been quietly developing. This isn’t a speculative move based on hype. It’s a strategic pivot toward value-driven projects. With BTC’s near-term ceiling uncertain, these early movers are positioning themselves in projects like Mutuum that still trade at the lower end of their lifecycle—but show signs of accelerating adoption and utility. What Makes Mutuum Finance Stand Out? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that’s currently in its presale phase, offering its token, MUTM, at just $0.025. So far, the results speak for themselves—over $5.8 million has been raised, and more than 7,500 holders have joined the ecosystem. The sale is now in its 4th phase, and all previous rounds sold out quickly. With the next price jump to $0.03 already confirmed, demand for this phase is rising fast. What’s pushing both retail and institutional interest is the combination of solid tokenomics, a real roadmap, and long-term earning potential. Mutuum is designed to go beyond short-term speculation. Its lending and borrowing protocol provides a foundation for actual financial use, and investors recognize the value in projects that aim to stay relevant years from now—not just for the next pump. Built for Long-Term Growth Whales and experienced DeFi users are seeing something different in MUTM: a token that rewards long-term participation. The mtToken model is one of the protocol’s key components—when users supply assets like ETH or USDC to the platform, they receive mtTokens in return, which grow in value as interest accrues. These can be held, transferred, or integrated into other DeFi applications, offering a reliable source of passive income. There’s also a buy-and-redistribute mechanism embedded in the protocol. A portion of the platform’s fees is used to buy MUTM from the market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers, adding consistent buy pressure and keeping the token in circulation while rewarding holders. Mutuum is not only focusing on core lending and borrowing tools—it’s also building out a stablecoin that will be fully backed and overcollateralized within its own ecosystem. The stablecoin will help users unlock liquidity without leaving the platform and keep value cycling through the protocol. Perhaps one of the strongest catalysts ahead is the upcoming beta release of the platform, planned to go live alongside the token launch. This means utility will be available immediately—users can lend, borrow, and earn from day one. For many investors, this sets Mutuum apart from projects that raise capital and delay product delivery. This hands-on access is expected to push demand for MUTM even higher, as early buyers will be able to immediately put their tokens to work and engage with the platform’s real use cases. As the market recalibrates and BTC continues to move sideways, investors are scanning for assets that offer both short-term upside and long-term fundamentals. Mutuum Finance is one of the rare presale projects ticking both boxes. With utility-driven features, a working roadmap, and whales already entering early, MUTM is quickly becoming a top contender for those planning their next big move in crypto.

            "BODY": "The crypto market is no stranger to volatility, and recent events have once again sent shockwaves across the industry. The ongoing market crash has pushed investors to seek assets with resilience and long-term growth potential. Fortunately, analysts have identified WallitIQ (WLTQ) as the most promising crypto asset amid the downturn. They believe its unique AI integration, resilience to market downturns, affordable entry price, and immense growth potential give it an edge over other crypto projects. Why Analysts Are Bullish On WallitIQ (WLTQ) Despite The Market Crash The ongoing market crash has erased billions in value from the crypto sector, causing double-digit losses for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major altcoins.

Historically, crypto projects with real-world applications tend to perform better when the market faces turbulence. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has demonstrated this strength by maintaining a steady trading volume and preserving investor confidence. Risk management is essential in crypto investing, particularly during periods of extreme volatility, as evidenced by the ongoing market crash, which has exposed liquidity weaknesses in many assets.

Following the launch of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) beta platform , the platform has gained increased exposure and is fast becoming an investor favorite.

            "BODY": "The post Dogecoin is Facing Rising Bearish Threat as It Drops Toward $0.16: Will Buyers Bounce Back? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin has experienced a significant decline in the past few hours, facing a sharp selloff near resistance levels. This drop was triggered by a statement from Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), clarifying that the U.S. government does not intend to adopt the widely-known memecoin, Dogecoin. Dogecoin’s Netflow Trends Negative Recently, Dogecoin’s price has taken a hit, significantly impacting various on-chain metrics. According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin saw over $9 million in total liquidations. This breakdown included $6.5 million from buyers closing long positions and $2.55 million from sellers ending their positions. Moreover, Dogecoin’s open interest, which measures the total outstanding trading positions, fell by 1.44%, dropping to around $1.6 billion. This decline followed an announcement by Elon Musk, clarifying that his government initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is not affiliated with the meme coin. This clarification came after a mix-up on a website showed the Dogecoin mascot, which temporarily sent Dogecoin’s price soaring by 14% in February. Also read: Elon Musk Says US Government Won’t Use Dogecoin, Price Dips 5% Elon Musk shared that the initiative was originally to be called the “Government Efficiency Commission” but was renamed following public feedback. The name coincidentally shares an acronym with Dogecoin, showing Musk’s well-known fondness for Dogecoin. However, the recent denial of any endorsement from Elon Musk has created a mixed sentiment in the market. This has made DOGE traders losing their hope, resulting in a sharp decline in its price. Coinglass data indicates that Dogecoin has seen a significant outflow of $4.2 million from exchanges in the last 24 hours, signaling that many holders are withdrawing their holdings. Despite the recent dip in price, this movement suggests that investors are seizing the opportunity to accumulate more Dogecoin. Such activities could potentially stabilize and boost the DOGE price if buying pressure continues to build during these lower price levels. What’s Next for the DOGE Price? Dogecoin has dropped below the EMA20 trend line, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. However, buyers are strongly defending a drop below the $0.16 level. As of writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.167, declining over 0.56% in the last 24 hours. The declining 20-day EMA ($0.171) and the RSI below the midpoint suggest a bearish sentiment in the short term. The DOGE/USDT pair may aim for a retest of $0.143 support level. A drop from this level could send the price toward $0.11. On the other hand, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day SMA, it will signal that the bulls are trying to form a higher low. If buyers push the price toward EMA trend lines, it will increase the possibility of a break above $0.2 resistance line. If buyers maintain the momentum within the resistance zone at $0.25, Dogecoin could attempt a rise toward $0.29.",

            "BODY": "A market analyst has argued that even if XRP reaches $100, it would still be significantly undervalued. According to Versan Aljarrah, host of The Black Swan Capitalist, the token’s fundamental role in the financial system warrants a valuation far beyond three figures, suggesting that a six-figure price may ultimately be required. Is XRP Undervalued Even at $100? In a recent statement on X , Aljarrah emphasized XRP’s unique ability to scale without limitations, making it an ideal asset for institutional finance. He suggested that as its value rises, its liquidity will improve, allowing it to facilitate increasingly large transactions. Although several projections have estimated XRP could reach $100, many industry analysts have dismissed this as unrealistic due to the high market capitalization it would entail. However, Aljarrah strongly disagrees with this perspective. He insists that, given its potential for widespread adoption, the token’s valuation could exceed $100 and move into six-figure territory. $XRP is currently breaking 7-year consolidation. $100 is definitely in range. Despite prolonged low volatility and hovering around the 200-day EMA, Firing Gary Gensler will be the catalyst for a bullish reversal. #XRP #Crypto #BullRun2024 pic.twitter.com/qci2ZlZc6f — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) November 2, 2024 Role in the Financial Market Shift Aljarrah’s argument aligns with broader discussions on the financial sector’s transformation. He has previously drawn comparisons between the current shift in finance and the disruptions seen in media and commerce over the past decades. To reinforce his point, he referenced Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital, who has highlighted the profound impact of the internet on various industries. According to Yusko, the emergence of streaming platforms disrupted traditional media, while e-commerce giants fundamentally altered retail markets. However, Yusko contends that the ongoing financial sector transformation is on an even greater scale. He describes finance as a multi-trillion-dollar industry, emphasizing that many observers fail to recognize the magnitude of this shift. Building on this idea, Aljarrah asserts that blockchain technology is central to this transformation. He believes the financial system is undergoing the largest wealth transfer in history, with blockchain redefining how value is stored and transferred. In his view, XRP is positioned at the core of this evolution, making early adoption critical for investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Analysts Predict a Higher XRP Valuation Aljarrah is not alone in predicting a substantial increase in XRP’s price. Crypto analyst Amelia (@Crypto_Barbie) has expressed a similar sentiment but with an even more bullish outlook. She considers a $100 target to be far too conservative, suggesting that XRP will eventually stabilize at a valuation in the five- or six-figure range. In addition, market expert Armando Pantoja previously projected a major breakout for XRP. In November 2024, when the token was priced at just $0.63, Pantoja noted that XRP was emerging from a seven-year consolidation phase and stated that reaching $100 was a realistic expectation. Pantoja also pointed to regulatory factors as potential price catalysts. He argued that a change in leadership at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—specifically, the removal of former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler—could drive XRP’s price higher. Since Gensler’s departure , the asset has already climbed to $2.15, marking a 256% increase since Pantoja’s original prediction. While some remain skeptical of such ambitious price targets , the debate surrounding XRP’s true valuation continues. Aljarrah and other analysts maintain that the token’s role in global finance is expanding, and if adoption accelerates, a valuation well beyond $100 could become a necessity rather than a speculative target.

            "BODY": "The Sui Network ( SUI ) will unlock nearly $150 million worth of its native token on April 1. This is part of Sui tokenomics and the monthly unlock schedule that inflates SUI’s circulating supply and dilutes investors’ holdings. Finbold has been monitoring and reporting Sui cliff unlocks according to data from Tokenomist . For example, December 1 saw Sui’s largest unlock in U.S. dollar value of 2024, unlocking $224 million worth of 64.19 million tokens. January 2025 had an even larger unlock nominal value for the same amount, valued at $274 million, as reported . February saw a lower unlock of $250 million , and an even larger drop occurred in March as the entire market collapsed – valued at $181.67 million. It is important, however, to understand that the unlocked amount in SUI tokens remains the same. The phenomenon is set to repeat tomorrow, on Tuesday, if SUI continues trading close to its current level. Indeed, the usual 64.2 million SUI unlock currently holds a nominal value of $147 million. This will artificially increase Sui’s circulating supply and market capitalization by 2.1% after the token unlock. Sui Network (SUI) Total Unlock Progress and Unlock Events. Source: Tokenomist / Finbold Over $445 million of token unlocks next week Overall, “Cliff Unlocks” data from Tokenomist also shows that $445.97 million will be unlocked by 45 cryptocurrency networks in the next seven days. Other projects with significant unlocks are Wormhole (W) and Ethena ( ENA ), with $117.30 million and $76.41 million, respectively. Yet, SUI still represents the largest share, unlocking around one-third of all upcoming cliff events for the next week on Tokenomist . However, Ripple’s XRP leads, as usual, the largest monthly unlocks in USD value of the entire market, unlocking over $2.6 billion in XRP on the same day as Sui. Cliff Unlocks Next seven days. Source: Tokenomist / Finbold SUI tokenomics and market effects Sui Series A and B investors receive the most, getting over 19 million SUI each, for 61% of the total. Mysten Labs gets the remaining 25.03 million, reserving 12.63 million for the community, 10.34 million for early contributors, and 2.07 million for its treasury. So far, the Sui Network has already unlocked 3.2 billion (32%) of its maximum capped supply of 10 billion SUI. At $2.29 per token, the “ Solana-killer ” has a fully diluted value (FDV) of $23 billion. This would put SUI, currently with a $7.3 billion capitalization, between Cardano ( ADA ) and Tron ( TRX ), each with a $23.6 billion and $22.5 billion market cap, respectively. SHIB, CTB, SUI, and HBAR ranked, in order, from 20 to 22 by market cap. Source: Finbold Notably, each time the network unlocks more tokens, it increases the potential selling pressure and artificially inflates the market cap. An increasing supply requires a similar, or better, increased demand to sustain its prices, according to the laws of economics. On that note, Adeniyi Abiodun revealed that the world’s “largest consumer platform” is coming to Sui Network this year . On a cautionary perspective, Sui has a unique tokenomics, which allows Mysten Labs and Series A/B investors to stake their locked tokens. These positions generate asymmetric liquid rewards against other staking investors, allowing these entities to sell these rewards or compound their staking positions over time.

            "SOURCE_ID": 82,
            "BODY": "Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The Bitcoin market is flashing a signal that seasoned analysts are taking seriously. We’re talking about the dreaded ‘dead cross’ on the MVRV indicator, and it’s suggesting that the recent market jitters might be more than just a temporary dip. Are we staring down the barrel of significant Bitcoin downside risk ? Let’s dive into what this means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Bitcoin MVRV Dead Cross: A Bearish Signal For those unfamiliar, MVRV stands for Market Value to Realized Value. It’s a crucial on-chain metric that helps us understand if Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. Think of it as a temperature gauge for the Bitcoin market. CryptoQuant analyst @Yonsei_dent recently highlighted a concerning development: Bitcoin’s 30-day Moving Average (DMA) MVRV has plunged below its 365-day DMA. This crossover, known as a ‘dead cross,’ is a historically bearish indicator. What exactly is a ‘dead cross’ and why should you care? Technical Indicator: The dead cross is a technical analysis pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. In this case, we’re looking at the 30-day and 365-day MVRV DMAs. Bearish Momentum: This crossover often signals weakening short-term momentum and a potential shift towards a downtrend. It suggests that recent market activity is trending lower relative to longer-term trends. Downward Pressure: Historically, dead crosses in MVRV have preceded periods of increased selling pressure and price declines in Bitcoin. In simpler terms, the Bitcoin MVRV dead cross suggests that the short-term market sentiment is becoming increasingly negative compared to the long-term average. This can translate to more sellers than buyers, pushing prices downwards. Is the Crypto Market Overheated? The MVRV Perspective The good news, if we can call it that, is that the MVRV is currently approaching its long-term average. This is actually a silver lining! When MVRV is significantly above its long-term average, it indicates an overheated market, ripe for a correction. The current MVRV level suggests that we’re no longer in that extreme overbought territory. However, this doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods. While the market might not be overheated, the dead cross formation is a separate, and arguably more immediate, concern. It signals a shift in momentum, regardless of the overall ‘temperature’ of the market. Think of it like this: even if the room isn’t boiling hot, a sudden cold draft can still make you shiver. Analyzing Bitcoin Price Analysis: No Bottom in Sight Yet? While the MVRV approaching its long-term average might offer some comfort in the long run, the analyst @Yonsei_dent points out a crucial caveat: no clear bottom has been confirmed yet. What does ‘no confirmed bottom’ mean for Bitcoin price analysis? Further Downside Possible: It implies that while the market may not be extremely overvalued, it also hasn’t reached a point where strong buying interest is emerging to halt the decline. Uncertainty Persists: Without a confirmed bottom, predicting the exact floor for Bitcoin becomes incredibly challenging. The market could still experience further drops before finding stable support. Patience Required: For investors looking to buy the dip, the message is clear: patience is key. Waiting for clearer signals of a bottom forming might be a prudent strategy to avoid catching a falling knife. Essentially, the Bitcoin price analysis based on MVRV and the dead cross is telling us to be cautious. While the market might not be in bubble territory, the current momentum is pointing downwards, and we haven’t seen definitive signs of a reversal. Navigating the Downside Risk: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do in the face of this potentially concerning signal? Panic selling is rarely the answer in the volatile crypto market. Instead, consider these actionable insights to navigate the current downside risk : Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Is your portfolio overly exposed to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies that might be affected by a further downturn? Risk Management: Implement or reinforce your risk management strategies. This could involve setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your holdings, or reducing your overall exposure to the crypto market if you feel uncomfortable with the current risk level. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market developments and on-chain metrics like MVRV. Follow reputable analysts and news sources to stay ahead of potential shifts in market sentiment. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) with Caution: If you’re a believer in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, consider dollar-cost averaging. However, in a period of potential downside, consider smaller, more frequent DCA buys rather than large lump-sum investments. Don’t Panic Sell: Emotional decisions in crypto can be costly. Understand that market corrections are a natural part of the cycle. Make informed decisions based on your own risk tolerance and investment strategy, not fear. Conclusion: Heed the Warning Signs, Stay Vigilant The Bitcoin MVRV dead cross is a stark reminder that the crypto market, while full of potential, is also inherently risky. It’s a signal that should not be ignored. While it doesn’t guarantee a massive price crash, it does suggest that the path of least resistance for Bitcoin, in the short-term at least, might be downwards. By understanding these indicators and implementing prudent risk management strategies, you can better navigate the choppy waters of the crypto market and position yourself for long-term success. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and remember that knowledge is your best tool in the world of cryptocurrency investing.
