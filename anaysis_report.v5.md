    # NARRATIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
    Emerging Narrative: The Convergence of AI Agents and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)

The most significant emerging market narrative is the accelerating convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). This trend is characterized by the development of blockchain-based solutions that leverage AI for automation and intelligence, while simultaneously building out decentralized physical infrastructure to provide real-world utility and generate sustainable revenue.

**AI Agents: Powering Decentralized Automation and Intelligence**

AI agents are at the forefront of this narrative, designed to autonomously execute complex blockchain tasks, optimize decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies, and provide real-time market intelligence. These agents can perform functions such as token swaps, yield farming, and lending, operating 24/7 to maximize efficiency and returns [941, 1008, 1016]. Projects are building specialized on-chain AI workers for various tasks, including getting the best token prices across DEXs, handling cross-chain token movements, and identifying optimal borrowing or lending opportunities [1016]. The goal is to create a smarter, autonomous future for finance, moving beyond guesswork to data-driven strategy [868]. Key players in this space include INFINIT, whose IN token powers one-click DeFi strategies and AI agent operations, with its Token Generation Event (TGE) scheduled for early August [990, 988]. TheoriqAI (THQ) is also central, described as the

### Fundamental Analysis

## Bittensor (TAO) Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol that establishes a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its primary goal is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, enabling a trustless, open, and transparent environment for AI consumers and producers to interact. Machine learning models within this network train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute. The protocol aims to foster open access, decentralized governance, and leverage globally distributed computing power for AI development and distribution.

### Technology & Use Case
Bittensor's core technology revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market. It allows machine intelligence to be measured and rewarded by other intelligence systems, irrespective of the specific task or dataset used for training. This approach aims to reward intelligence applicable to a broader range of objectives, monetize niche or legacy systems, and enable smaller, diverse systems to find value within a high-resolution reward landscape. The network uses a digital ledger to record ranks and provide incentives in a decentralized manner.

Key technological mechanisms include:
*   **Peer-Ranking**: Peers use the outputs of others as inputs to themselves and learn a set of weights (`W`) by measuring the value of signals produced by their peers. High-ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
*   **Collusion Resistance (Incentive Function)**: The protocol employs an incentive function (`I(W, S)`) that limits rewards to peers who have not reached consensus, making it difficult for small groups to achieve inflation. This mechanism assumes no single group holds more than 50% of the network's stake, requiring peers to attract votes from the majority to gain inflation.
*   **Bonds**: To incentivize correct weight selection, the mechanism incorporates speculation-based rewards in the form of bonds (`B`). Peers accumulate bonds in those they rank, and those who bond in peers that others later value receive increased inflation. This encourages speculation on the future value of other peers' contributions.
*   **Consensus Mechanism**: The chain actively measures a loss term (`L = -R â‹… (C - 0.5)`) to ensure that the majority of inflation is distributed towards peers with majority consensus. If this condition is not met, the chain increases the number of weights miners set across the network until consensus is achieved, preventing attacks where a dishonest sub-graph competes with the honest network.
*   **Tensor Standardization**: A common encoding of inputs and outputs (tensor modalities like TEXT, IMAGE, SPEECH) is required for different model types to interact, allowing for the partitioning and eventual bridging of the network into a multi-modality landscape.

The use case is compelling as it addresses the centralization of AI development and aims to democratize access to and monetization of machine intelligence. By creating a market where AI models are continuously trained, evaluated, and rewarded in a decentralized manner, Bittensor offers a novel approach to AI production and distribution.

### Tokenomics
Bittensor's native token is TAO. The tokenomics are designed to incentivize participants to contribute valuable machine intelligence to the network.

*   **Supply**: The `total_supply` and `max_supply` are both 21,000,000 TAO. The `circulating_supply` is 9,597,491.0 TAO.
*   **Reward Mechanism**: Machine learning models are rewarded in TAO based on the informational value they offer the collective. Rewards are distributed as newly minted stake (`Î”S`) according to bond ownership.
*   **Inflation/Deflation**: The whitepaper describes an inflation mechanism where stake (`S`) increases over time (`St+1 = St + Ï„I`), driven by the incentive function (`I`). The bond mechanism (`Bt+1 = Bt + W â‹… S`) also dictates how peers accumulate bonds, which in turn influences their share of inflation (`Î”S = BT â‹… I`). The system is designed to distribute rewards to peers who help minimize the network's overall loss objective and correctly select weights, thereby linking inflation to productive contributions and consensus.

Specific details regarding initial token distribution to the team or investors are not provided in the given data.

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective. TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs. Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- Bittensor enables: -A novel, optimized strategy for the development and distribution of artificial intelligence technology by leveraging the possibilities of a distributed ledger. Specifically, its facilitation of open access/ownership, decentralized governance, and the ability to harness globally-distributed resources of computing power and innovation within an incentivized framework. -An open-source repository of machine intelligence, accessible to anyone, anywhere, thus creating the conditions for open and permission-less innovation on a global internet scale. -Distribution of rewards and network ownership to users in direct proportion to the value they have added
- We propose a market where intelligence is priced by other intelligence systems peer-to-peer across the internet. Peers rank each other by training neural networks which learn the value of their neighbors. Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- A new commodity needs a new type of market (` 1 `). This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them. By changing the basis against which machine intelligence is measured, (` 1 `) the market can reward intelligence that is applicable to a much larger set of objectives, (` 2 `) legacy systems can be monetized for their unique value, and (` 3 `) smaller diverse systems can find niches within a much higher resolution reward landscape.
- Our network is composed of n functions F = f 0 ,. f n \ F = f_{0},. f_{n} \: F = f 0 ,. f n peers where each is holding zero or more network weight S = [ s i ] \ S = [s_{i}] \: S = [ s i ] stake represented on a digital ledger.
- Our goal is the distribution of stake I , as an incentive, to peers who have helped minimize the loss-objective (Figure-1), and importantly, in such a way that, it is difficult for a small proportion of stake to collude as a means to maximize their distribution in the network without minimizing the loss (Figure-3). (` 1 `) S t + 1 = S t + Ï„ I \ S_{t+1} = S_{t} + \tau I S t + 1 = S t + Ï„ I
- In this paper, we suggest this can be achieved through peer-ranking, where peers use the outputs of others F ( x ) = [ f 0 ( x ). f n ( x ) ] \ F(x) = [f_{0}(x). f_{n}(x)] \: F ( x ) = [ f 0 ( x ). f n ( x )] as inputs to themselves f ( F ( x ) ) \ f(F(x)) \: f ( F ( x )) and learn a set of weights W = [ w i , j ] \ W = [w_{i,j}] \: W = [ w i , j ] where peer i is responsible for setting the i th row through transactions on a digital ledger.
- We extended the naive ranking method to evade collusion with an incentive function I ( W , S ) \ I(W, S) \: I ( W , S ) which limits reward to peers that have not reached consensus in the network. Assuming no group of peers holds more than the majority of stake in the system, then peers can only attain inflation by working to attract votes from the majority: a core assumption in many decentralized systems like Bitcoin.
- We introduce these incentives by adapting the inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward in the form of bonds B. Here, b i , j B \ b_{i,j} \in B \: b i , j B is the proportion of bonds owned by peer i in peer j. (` 6 `) B = [ b 0 , 0 b 0 , 1 b 0 , 2 b 0 , 3 b 1 , 0 b 1 , 1 b 1 , 2 b 1 , 3 b 2 , 0 b 2 , 1 b 2 , 2 b 2 , 3 b 3 , 0 b 3 , 1 b 3 , 2 b 3 , 3 ] B = \begin{bmatrix} b_{0,0} & b_{0,1} & b_{0,2} & b_{0,3} \\ b_{1,0} & b_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & b_{1,3} \\ b_{2,0} & b_{2,1} & b_{2,2} & b_{2,3} \\ b_{3,0} & b_{3,1} & b_{3,2} & b_{3,3} \end{bmatrix} B = b 0 , 0 b 1 , 0 b 2 , 0 b 3 , 0 b 0 , 1 b 1 , 1 b 2 , 1 b 3 , 1 b 0 , 2 b 1 , 2 b 2 , 2 b 3 , 2 b 0 , 3 b 1 , 3 b 2 , 3 b 3 , 3
- Bonds accumulate at each step similarly to token inflation where Î” B = W S \ \Delta B = W \cdot S \: Î” B = W S In this way, peers accumulate bonds in the peers they rank, thus bonding themselves to those that they are connected to. (` 7 `) B t + 1 = B t + W S \ B_{t+1} = B_{t} + W \cdot S B t + 1 = B t + W S Using the B bond matrix, the chain redistributes the normal incentive scores Î” S = B T I \ \Delta S = B{T} \cdot I \: Î” S = B T I Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves. Thus it makes sense for peers to accumulate bonds in peers which it expects to do well according to other peers with stake in the system - thus speculating on their future value.
- The chain can measure this through a loss term L = R ( C 0. 5 ) \ {\mathcal{L}} = -R \cdot (C - 0. 5) \: L = R ( C 0. The term is negative if the majority of inflation is being distributed towards peers with more than 0. The chain uses the loss calculation as a peg. By increasing the number of weights the average miner sets across the network the chain can ensure consensus.
- A common encoding of inputs and outputs is required for the various model types and input types to interact. The use of tensor modalities can be used to partition the network into disjoint graphs. At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.

## Virtuals protocol
### Fundamental Analysis

# Virtuals Protocol: Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Virtuals Protocol is an AI x Metaverse protocol focused on building the future of virtual interactions. It aims to address the challenges of decentralized and independent autonomous AI agents collaborating, specifically the risk of compounding information loss due to misinterpretation, hallucination, or incomplete data exchange. The core solution is the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized, framework-agnostic protocol designed for many-to-many decentralized autonomous systems. ACP leverages blockchain technology to secure and streamline information exchange, enabling safe, secure, and verifiable autonomous agent commerce.

## Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Virtuals Protocol is the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a four-phase interaction model implemented via smart contracts to facilitate transparent, verifiable, and tamper-resistant interactions between autonomous agents and humans. The protocol is built on four foundational principles: Framework and Capability Agnosticism, Atomicity and Defined States, Deterministic Outcomes and Single Source of Truth, and Cryptographic Verifiability.

**The four core phases of ACP are:**
1.  **Request Phase:** Establishes initial interaction, mandates clear identification via cryptographic signatures, uses a standardized request format, and includes an explicit accept/reject decision point with optional timeout mechanisms.
2.  **Negotiation Phase:** Critical stage for establishing concrete terms of agreement. It centers on a Proof of Agreement (PoA) as an immutable record of agreed terms, which includes service parameters, temporal constraints, compensation, and evaluation requirements. Agreements require multi-signature verification and a two-phase commitment process.
3.  **Transaction Phase:** Handles the execution of agreed-upon terms using existing blockchain transactions. This includes payment to a contract wallet and delivery of the service, both of which are withheld until the evaluation phase is complete.
4.  **Evaluation Phase:** Provides mechanisms for quality assessment and performance feedback. It enables reputation building and system improvement, supporting both human and agent evaluators. This phase also facilitates a specialized marketplace for evaluator agents, who are incentivized through a fee structure (typically 2-3% of transaction value) for their services.

The use case is compelling as it addresses a significant challenge in the emerging autonomous agent ecosystem: enabling reliable, secure, and verifiable commerce between independent AI agents. By providing a standardized protocol, Virtuals Protocol aims to unlock the potential for autonomous businesses where specialized agents can collaborate effectively, mitigating risks like information loss and lack of interoperability inherent in decentralized systems.

## Tokenomics
The tokenomics of Virtuals Protocol are primarily defined by its supply parameters and the economic model supporting the Agent Commerce Protocol, particularly the incentivization of evaluator agents.

*   **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 tokens
*   **Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 tokens
*   **Circulating Supply:** 655,322,002.0525419 tokens

The whitepaper highlights an economic model within the Evaluation Phase, where evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or a set value as part of the contract agreement) as compensation. This mechanism aims to create incentives for developers to build and maintain sophisticated evaluation agents, justify operational costs, encourage specialization, and enable a self-sustaining ecosystem of evaluation services. While the whitepaper details this incentive mechanism for evaluators, it does not explicitly detail the overall token distribution (e.g., allocations for team, investors, community, treasury) or other specific inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond the transaction fees for evaluators.

### Proof
- description: An AI x Metaverse Protocol that is building the future of virtual interactions
- whitepaper_text: Autonomous Businesses with Agent Commerce Protocol Virtuals Protocol Abstract In the evolving agentic ecosystem, we observe that autonomous agents can now operate with minimal human oversight, pursue clearly defined goals, and even manage permissionless crypto wallets - enabling them to exert influence on hu- mans and other AI agents alike. Furthermore, these agents increasingly leverage social media platforms (e. Twitter/X) as a communication fabric to seamlessly coordinate with both humans and fellow autonomous entities. Concurrently, agents are specializing within distinct capability or action spaces, creating economic value and competitive moats around their expertise. However, such specialization necessitates collaboration among multiple independent agents to address each others gaps in knowledge or functionality. This can lead to the emergence of autonomous businesses, where the collective economic output exceeds the sum of each individual agents contributions. Unlike more conventional swarm-based LLM approaches, which carefully coordinate and trigger interactions between agents with rules, we posit that independent specialized agents working together can yield exponentially greater value by virtue of their distinct models, datasets, and action spaces. Yet the decentralized and independent nature of these agents also intro- duces the risk of compounding information loss - whether due to misinterpretation, hallucination, or incomplete data exchange - since they do not operate as part of a single, tightly coupled multi-agent architecture. To address these challenges, we present the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized framework designed for many-to-many decentralized autonomous systems. ACP leverages blockchain technology to secure and streamline information exchange while introducing a four-phase interaction model - Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluation - implemented via smart contracts. This ensures transparent, verifiable, and tamper- resistant interactions. Crucially, ACP also proposes the use of evaluator agents, which audit and validate transactions, thereby enhancing trust and facilitating a new market driven by aligned incentives. We demonstrate ACPs utility through a practical example involving specialized agents that coordinate, negotiate, and transact under the ACP standard. By maintaining implementation-agnostic prin- ciples, ACP establishes a robust foundation for autonomous commerce, offering broad applicability across diverse agent frameworks and ecosystems.
- whitepaper_text: This paper presents the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP). ACP addresses these challenges by providing a framework and system agnostic protocol that Preprint. defines the fundamental phases and requirements for safe, secure and verifiable autonomous agent commerce, by building on the strengths of the blockchain beyond just payments. ACP was designed with AI agents and autonomous systems first in mind but is also friendly to human agents, making it adaptable for marketplaces and societies that are characterized by a current majority of human agents but will be increasingly filled with AI agents as their utility and agency increases.
- whitepaper_text: ACP is constructed upon four fundamental principles that govern its design and implementation. These principles ensure the protocols flexibility, reliability, and broad applicability across different autonomous systems. Commerce and transactions should be safe, secure, trustable and verifiable. But it should not be more complicated than necessary. Framework and Capability Agnosticism. This principle establishes that the protocol makes no assumptions about the internal implementation of participating entities. This deliberate design choice enables any system, regardless of its underlying architecture or capabilities, to participate in the protocol as long as it adheres to the specified interaction patterns. A decentralized solution has to be framework and capability agnostic. This principle mandates that each phase within the protocol must have explicitly defined entry and exit conditions. This atomicity ensures that transactions cannot exist in intermediate or undefined states, providing clarity and certainty about the interaction and transactions progress at any given moment. The defined states also fully align with agentic principles where states should be clearly defined at any moment to enable agents to best make decisions on what should be done next. Deterministic Outcomes and Single Source of Truth. Outcome-based principle establishes that each phase must have clearly defined success and failure conditions. This deterministic nature ensures that all participants can independently arrive at the same conclusion about a phases status, eliminating ambiguity and reducing the potential for disputes. This principle requires that agreements within the protocol must be cryptographically verifiable. This verification requirement creates an immutable audit trail of the transactions progres- sion and agreed terms. This ensures that all participants can independently validate the state of any transaction. Importantly for autonomous agents, this also means that any participant can securely recall and retrieve past transactions and past terms.
- whitepaper_text: 1 Request Phase The Request Phase establishes the initial interaction between participants. This phase defines the participants of the proposed transaction and determines preliminary compatibility. This phase implements several critical requirements that establish the foundation for potential transactions. First 2 Figure 1: Flow between the different phases of a transaction. and foremost, it mandates clear identification of all participating entities through cryptographic signatures and verifiable addresses. This identification process ensures that all subsequent interactions can be properly authenticated and attributed. The protocol requires all requests to follow a standardized specification format that encapsulates the essential parameters of the proposed transaction. This standardization ensures that receiving entities can properly evaluate and process incoming requests regardless of their internal implementation details. A crucial component of the Request Phase is the explicit accept/reject decision point. This mandatory decision ensures that no transaction can proceed to negotiation without clear consent from all participating entities. The decision point serves as a gate keeper, preventing unnecessary resource allocation to incompatible or unwanted transactions. Timeout mechanisms can be implemented to prevent indefinite pending states and ensure protocol efficiency. These mechanisms automatically terminate requests that remain unprocessed beyond specified timeframes, preventing resource lock-up and maintaining system fluidity. State Transitions within the Request Phase follow strict rules: 1. Initial phase entry requires cryptographically valid identification from the requesting entity, ensuring transaction attribution from the outset. Progression to the Negotiation Phase can only occur upon explicit acceptance from the receiving entity/entities, preventing unauthorized or premature advancement. In cases of rejection, the protocol mandates the provision of standardized reason codes, en- abling systematic tracking and analysis of failed requests while providing valuable feedback to requesting entities.
- whitepaper_text: 2 Negotiation Phase The Negotiation Phase represents the critical stage where participating entities establish concrete terms of agreement through a deterministic process. This phase implements mechanisms to ensure that all terms are unambiguously specified and cryptographically verifiable. At the core of the Negotiation Phase lies the Proof of Agreement (PoA). The PoA serves as an immutable record of the agreed negotiated terms and will be used in the Evaluation Phase. The Negotiation Phase enables participants to establish mutually acceptable terms through any process but must conclude and end with an agreed term specification. This can be in the form of a conversation, or already pre-specified prices and services. Term specifications within the protocol follow a standardized but absolutely simple structure that captures only necessary essential elements of the agreement. These specifications must include: 1. Agreed Service: Service delivery parameters with success criteria decided upon in the Evaluation phase. Constraints: Temporal constraints including execution deadlines and timeout conditions 3. Compensation: Price and compensation terms with precise token or currency specifications 4. Evaluation: Whether evaluation is required and must be passed. Negotiation Thread: Entire negotiation thread documented and used as reference for evaluation. In the future, AI evaluators should be able to read, understand, infer and evaluate all the fields from agreed service, constraints, compensation and evaluation all from the negotiation thread. In v1, only the final agreed-upon terms are committed on-chain, optimizing for both cost and speed while maintaining security while subsequent versions could include a summary or record of the entire negotiation process and messages. Either party can propose terms of the agreement, while the contract only moves to the next phase when the counter-party agrees and signs the contract. Agreement verification mechanisms employ multi-signature schemes where all participants must independently verify and sign the final agreement. This dual-signature requirement ensures that no party can unilaterally alter terms after agreement. The protocol mandates a two-phase commitment process where: 1. Agreed terms are proposed and signed by a party. Counter-signing by the receiving party creates the binding agreement as PoA.
- whitepaper_text: 3 Transaction Phase The Transaction Phase handles the execution of agreed-upon terms through secure operations. This makes use of existing blockchain transactions, and uses the contract to check the execution of these transactions. The two transactions that must occur is the: Payment to the contract wallet/address Delivery of the service to the contract wallet/address Both payment and the service are withheld, until the evaluation phase is complete.
- whitepaper_text: 4 Evaluation Phase The Evaluation Phase provides mechanisms for quality assessment and performance feedback, enabling reputation building and system improvement. The Evaluation Phase represents the protocols commitment to continuous learning improvement and accountability, necessary for an agentic and autonomous society, through an evaluation and feedback system. Evaluator requirements and assignment can be decided by the initiating entity, with the protocol agnostic to the type of evaluators, supporting both human and agent evaluators. Evaluations 4 are conducted based on the agreed terms established in the negotiation phase, with mandatory feedback responses regardless of acceptance or rejection. Evaluators have read-access to data in the term specification of the smart contract agreement. This requirement serves multiple purposes: Enables continuous learning and improvement for service providers Generates valuable transaction and performance data Contributes to the overall systems reputation mechanisms Provides market signals for evaluator agent development For transactions where evaluation is deemed unnecessary, this must be explicitly agreed upon in the term specification during the negotiation phase. This optionality is a required field in the term specification, ensuring conscious decision-making about evaluation requirements. Additionally, this also opens up opportunities for evaluators (evaluator agents) to participate and share in the agentic economy. This incentivizes high-quality evaluation agents. Specialized Evaluator Agents Market. The protocol enables the emergence of a sophisticated marketplace for specialized evaluator agents. These agents can be developed and trained for specific domains and use cases, such as: Software quality assessment agents specialized in code review and performance testing Content evaluation agents trained for specific creative works and digital assets This specialization allows for highly accurate and domain-specific evaluations, improving the overall quality of transactions within the network. Economic Model and Incentives. To ensure sustainable operation of high-quality evaluator agents, the protocol enables implementation of a fee structure where evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or set value part of the contract agreement) as compensation for their services. This economic model: Creates incentives for developers to build and maintain sophisticated evaluation agents Justifies the computational and operational costs of running evaluation services Encourages specialization and continuous improvement of evaluation capabilities Enables a self-sustaining ecosystem of evaluation services Selection of evaluators and fee structures can be dynamically determined based on: Complexity of evaluation required Specialization level of the evalua

## Bittensor
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bittensor (TAO)

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol designed to power a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core vision is to establish a "pure market for artificial intelligence," enabling a trustless, open, and transparent environment where consumers and producers of AI can interact. The project aims to solve the problem of centralized AI development and monetization by creating an incentivized arena where machine intelligence is collaboratively trained and valued by other intelligence systems peer-to-peer across the internet. Contributors are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they provide to the collective.

### Technology & Use Case
Bittensor's technology revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market. Machine learning models (peers) train collaboratively, and their outputs are used as inputs by other peers. Peers learn to assign weights to each other, effectively ranking them based on the value of their signals. This ranking system, recorded on a digital ledger, forms the basis for distributing TAO rewards. The network incorporates an incentive mechanism designed to resist collusion, ensuring that peers attain inflation by attracting votes from the majority, a core assumption similar to decentralized systems like Bitcoin. Furthermore, a "bonds" mechanism is introduced, allowing peers to speculate on the future value of other peers, thereby incentivizing the correct selection of weights. The utility of the TAO token is central to the ecosystem: it serves as the reward mechanism for contributors, grants external users access to extract information from the network, and represents network ownership. The use case is compelling as it seeks to decentralize AI development, foster open and permissionless innovation, and directly monetize machine intelligence work, thereby creating a global, accessible repository of AI.

### Tokenomics
Bittensor has a total supply and a maximum supply of 21,000,000 TAO tokens. The circulating supply is 9,597,491 TAO. The economic model is inflationary, as new TAO tokens (referred to as "newly minted stake" or "token inflation") are distributed into the network. Rewards are given to peers who contribute informational value, and this distribution is tied to a bond ownership mechanism. Peers accumulate bonds in those they rank highly, and those who have accumulated bonds in peers that are later valued by others receive increased inflation themselves. While the total and max supply are capped, the mechanism of "newly minted stake" implies continuous issuance up to the maximum supply, directly linked to network contributions and the bond system.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not include specific information regarding the Bittensor team's background. However, the whitepaper outlines a clear roadmap for the network's expansion concerning data modalities. Initially, the network will be seeded with a single modality, TEXT. The plan is to progressively expand to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR modalities. Eventually, the roadmap envisions the integration of multi-modality combinations, such as TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into a more complex and versatile AI landscape. This indicates a clear developmental path focused on increasing the network's capabilities and applicability across various forms of machine intelligence.

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective. TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs.
- Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- We propose a market where intelligence is priced by other intelligence systems peer-to-peer across the internet.
- The result is a collectively run intelligence market that continually produces newly trained models and pays contributors who create information theoretic value.
- Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective.
- TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs.
- Bittensor enables: -A novel, optimized strategy for the development and distribution of artificial intelligence technology by leveraging the possibilities of a distributed ledger. Specifically, its facilitation of open access/ownership, decentralized governance, and the ability to harness globally-distributed resources of computing power and innovation within an incentivized framework. -An open-source repository of machine intelligence, accessible to anyone, anywhere, thus creating the conditions for open and permission-less innovation on a global internet scale. -Distribution of rewards and network ownership to users in direct proportion to the value they have added
- This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them.
- The constructed market uses a digital ledger to record ranks and to provide incentives to peers in a decentralized manner. The chain measures trust, making it difficult for peers to attain rewards without providing value to the majority.
- We extended the naive ranking method to evade collusion with an incentive function I ( W , S ) \ I(W, S) \: I ( W , S ) which limits reward to peers that have not reached consensus in the network.
- We introduce these incentives by adapting the inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward in the form of bonds B.
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- total_supply: 21000000.0
- circulating_supply: 9597491.0
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network
- Distribution of rewards and network ownership to users in direct proportion to the value they have added
- Bonds accumulate at each step similarly to token inflation where Î” B = W S \ \Delta B = W \cdot S \: Î” B = W S
- Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves.
- At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.

## Render
### Fundamental Analysis

# Render (RNDR) Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Render Network is a decentralized GPU compute platform designed to address the significant bottleneck in computational infrastructure for producing next-generation media, machine learning, and generative AI. It connects node operators with idle GPU power to artists and developers who require scalable and intensive 3D rendering and machine learning capabilities. The network aims to provide a platform for a wide array of computation tasks, facilitating them swiftly and efficiently through a blockchain-based peer-to-peer network, ensuring secure property rights and democratizing access to digital creativity tools.

## Technology & Use Case
**Core Technology:** The Render Network operates as a decentralized GPU compute platform, leveraging a blockchain-based peer-to-peer network. It consists of an off-chain rendering network (comprising Creators, Node Operators, and application layer vendors) and blockchain layers that handle RNDR payments and escrow contracts. The system uses OctaneBench, a proprietary benchmarking tool, to standardize GPU performance and determine pricing for rendering tasks via a Multi-Tier Pricing (MTP) algorithm. Resource allocation is managed through Job Allocation (prioritizing Creator reputation) and Node Allocation (assigning work based on tier, hardware, time on network, user/node reputation, and OctaneBench score). Privacy and security are maintained through end-to-end encryption, hashing, virtualization, and secure centralized storage, with all individual frames watermarked prior to download.

**RNDR Token Utility:** The RNDR token is central to the network's operation. Node operators contribute their unused GPUs to the network and earn RNDR for processing artists' rendering needs. This establishes a token-based billing model for server-side rendering, where RNDR facilitates payments between creators and node operators. The token is essential for incentivizing GPU power contribution and enabling the transactional process within the decentralized network.

**Use Cases:** The Render Network supports a broad spectrum of GPU workloads, including:
*   **Visual Effects and Motion Graphics:** Enabling independent artists and studios to produce large-scale 3D visual effects without prohibitive upfront capital expenditure.
*   **Virtual Assets and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):** Facilitating the creation of NFTs and virtual assets with deep provenance and the monetization of portable 3D virtual assets.
*   **Virtual Production:** Transforming filmmaking by combining live action with large-scale rendered 3D environments.
*   **Additional Rendering Applications:** This includes projection mapping (for large-scale graphics), product design (rapid prototyping), architecture (immersive 3D visualizations), simulation (complex physically-based rendering for scientific applications), and visualization (hyperrealistic content for training).
*   **Emerging Applications:** Supporting Augmented Reality (AR) and Gaming (cloud-streamed immersive content) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications (prompt-based 3D content, holographic rendering, inference, and AI training with DRM features).

**Compelling and Essential Use Case:** The use case is compelling as it directly addresses the critical shortage and high cost of centralized GPU compute resources, which are increasingly demanded by next-generation media and AI technologies. By harnessing idle GPU cycles through a decentralized model, Render Network offers a scalable, economically efficient, and accessible alternative, making it essential for creators and developers facing computational bottlenecks.

## Tokenomics
*   **Total Supply:** 532,888,942.3362826 RNDR
*   **Circulating Supply:** 518,128,769.0562826 RNDR
*   **Max Supply:** 644,245,094.0 RNDR

**Distribution and Mechanisms:** The provided documentation indicates that Node Operators earn RNDR for processing rendering tasks, establishing a token-based billing model. Payments are handled via RNDR and escrow contracts on blockchain layers, ensuring public verifiability. While the whitepaper details the earning mechanism for node operators, it does not provide specific information regarding the initial distribution of tokens to the team, investors, or community, nor does it explicitly outline inflationary or deflationary mechanisms beyond the earning model for service provision.

## Filecoin
### Fundamental Analysis

# Filecoin (FIL) Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that aims to create a global market for data storage. It addresses the problem of centralized data storage by enabling anyone worldwide to participate as storage providers, thereby achieving economies of scale. The network seeks to transform storage into a commodity or utility, where the price is determined by supply and demand rather than corporate pricing departments. Miners on the network compete based on factors like reliability and price.

## Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Filecoin revolves around creating a robust global market for storage. It decouples hard-drive space from additional services, allowing for a more efficient and competitive storage environment. The primary use case is providing decentralized data storage, making it a utility where the cost is driven by market forces. This approach aims to offer a more resilient, open, and potentially more cost-effective alternative to traditional centralized storage solutions. The compelling nature of the use case lies in its potential to democratize data storage and introduce market-driven efficiencies.

## Tokenomics

## Wrapped steth
### Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary

Wrapped stETH (wstETH) is a wrapped version of stETH, designed to provide a stable representation of staked Ethereum (stETH) and its accumulated earnings without the daily rebasing mechanism of stETH. It functions similarly to a c-token, representing a pro-rata ownership of the underlying staked ETH. The project aims to enhance participation in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by providing a liquid token that represents staked collateral and earnings, thereby removing the need for users to run their own staking infrastructure. wstETH is categorized as a Crypto-Backed Token, Wrapped-Token, Liquid Staking Token, and is part of the Ethereum and Unichain Ecosystems, focusing on Liquid Staking.

### Technology & Use Case

wstETH's core technology involves wrapping stETH, which allows it to accrue value without daily changes to the user's balance. Instead, the value of wstETH increases relative to stETH over time. When a user unwraps wstETH, they receive their principal stETH along with any accumulated stETH earnings. This mechanism makes wstETH more compatible with various DeFi protocols that may not natively support rebasing tokens. The primary utility of wstETH is to enable continued participation in DeFi while earning staking rewards from Lido, a liquid staking protocol for Proof-of-Stake blockchains. By providing a liquid representation of staked ETH, wstETH allows users to maintain liquidity and engage in other DeFi activities (e.g., lending, borrowing, providing liquidity) without forfeiting their staking rewards. The use case is compelling as it addresses the illiquidity challenge often associated with traditional staking, offering flexibility and capital efficiency to stakers.

### Tokenomics

wstETH operates on a dynamic supply model where tokens are minted when stETH is wrapped and burned when wstETH is unwrapped. This means its supply is directly tied to the amount of stETH being wrapped and unwrapped, rather than a fixed or capped supply. As of the provided data, the circulating supply is 3,238,636.512802212 wstETH, with a total supply of 3,235,480.62195855 wstETH. The market capitalization stands at $14,187,268,580, which is equal to its fully diluted valuation, indicating that all existing tokens are currently in circulation or accounted for in the market cap calculation. There is no specified maximum supply, suggesting an infinite supply capacity dictated by the demand for wrapped stETH.

### Team & Roadmap

Information regarding the specific team members, their backgrounds, or a detailed future roadmap for Wrapped stETH is not available in the provided fundamental data. The `link_to_whitepaper` field is empty, indicating no direct access to a whitepaper for further insights into the project's long-term vision or development plans. Furthermore, the developer activity data shows no recent public activity, with metrics such as forks, stars, subscribers, total issues, closed issues, pull requests merged, pull request contributors, code additions/deletions, and commit counts all reported as zero. This suggests either a lack of public repository activity, a mature project with less active development, or that the provided data source does not capture this information.

### Proof
- wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH.
- Instead of rebasing, or changing account holdings daily it is similar to a c-token.
- It represents a pro-rata ownership of the staked ETH (stETH).
- When someone exits wstETH they are returned principal stETH + stETH earnings.
- Lido is a liquid staking protocol for POS blockchains.

# Technical Analysis Reports
## Bittensor
### Trend Analysis
The price of Bittensor is currently trading below both its 13-period EMA (370.62) and its 21-period SMA (397.94). Furthermore, the 13-period EMA is positioned below the 21-period SMA. A significant death cross, where the EMA crossed below the SMA, occurred around 2025-02-28, marking a shift to a bearish trend that has largely continued to the end of the data series. Prior to this, a golden cross (EMA above SMA) was observed around 2024-11-11, indicating an uptrend, which was then followed by another death cross around 2025-01-14, reinforcing the bearish sentiment that has dominated the recent period.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI is currently at 39.09, which is in the neutral range (between 30 and 70). Over the past few days, the RSI has been trending downwards from higher neutral levels (e.g., 50.23 on 2025-07-29), indicating weakening buying momentum and increasing selling pressure. It briefly dipped into oversold territory (34.11 on 2025-08-03) before a slight rebound, but the overall trajectory remains bearish.

### Volume Analysis
Recent price movements have been accompanied by mixed volume signals. The price drop from 2025-08-01 to 2025-08-02 was confirmed by an increase in volume (from 121.96M to 185.63M). However, the subsequent price drop on 2025-08-03 saw a decrease in volume (to 95.96M), suggesting a lack of strong conviction in that specific decline. The brief price increase on 2025-08-04 was accompanied by slightly decreased volume (94.11M), indicating a lack of strong buying conviction. The most recent price drop on 2025-08-05 (from 357.89 to 343.44) occurred with a slight decrease in volume (from 95.95M to 92.24M), which might suggest a weakening of selling pressure, but it still represents a price decline.

### Outlook
Bittensor is currently in a clear downtrend, as evidenced by the price consistently trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with the EMA also below the SMA. A death cross occurred around 2025-02-28, and this bearish trend has largely persisted. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is weakening, trending downwards within the neutral zone and briefly touching oversold levels. While some recent price declines were confirmed by increased volume, the most recent price drop on 2025-08-05 occurred on slightly decreasing volume, suggesting a potential weakening of immediate selling conviction but not a reversal of the established downtrend. The overall technical outlook for Bittensor remains bearish.

## Near protocol
### Trend Analysis
The overall trend for NEAR Protocol has shifted to bearish. A significant bearish crossover, commonly known as a 'death cross,' occurred around 2025-08-01, where the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossed below the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Specifically, on 2025-07-31, the EMA was 2.7686 and the SMA was 2.7556 (EMA > SMA), while on 2025-08-01, the EMA was 2.7356 and the SMA was 2.7567 (EMA < SMA). Since this crossover, the price has consistently traded below both the EMA and SMA. The latest price of 2.514 is below the 13-period EMA of 2.5917 and the 21-period SMA of 2.7340, confirming the current downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for NEAR Protocol was in overbought territory between 2025-07-20 and 2025-07-23, with readings above 72. It then experienced a sharp decline, moving into the neutral range (30-70) from 2025-07-24 onwards. The most recent RSI reading is 46.23, which is within the neutral zone. While there has been a slight rebound in the RSI over the last two days (from 37.83 on 2025-08-03 to 46.23 on 2025-08-05), it remains well below overbought levels, indicating a loss of strong upward momentum.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume analysis confirms the recent price action, particularly the downward movements. A notable increase in volume was observed on 2025-08-02 (352.45M), which coincided with a significant price drop, indicating strong selling pressure and conviction behind the decline. In contrast, the subsequent slight price rebounds on 2025-08-04 (101.34M) and 2025-08-05 (150.65M) occurred on relatively lower volumes compared to the preceding sell-offs. This suggests that the recent upward price movements lack strong buying conviction and may not be sustainable.

### Outlook
NEAR Protocol is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The recent death cross, where the 13-period EMA fell below the 21-period SMA, signals a shift to a downtrend. The price is trading below both key moving averages, reinforcing this bearish sentiment. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has cooled significantly from overbought conditions and remains in the neutral zone, suggesting a lack of strong buying pressure. Furthermore, recent downward price movements were confirmed by increased volume, while attempts at price recovery have occurred on comparatively lower volume, indicating a lack of conviction from buyers. This combination of indicators suggests that NEAR Protocol may continue to face downward pressure or consolidate in the near term.

## Artificial superintelligence alliance
### Trend Analysis
The price of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is in a clear downtrend. A bearish 'death cross' occurred on 2025-07-30, where the 13-period EMA crossed below the 21-period SMA. Since this crossover, the price has consistently traded below both the EMA and SMA, and both moving averages are trending downwards, confirming the established bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has shown a significant decline in the latter part of the data, dropping from levels in the mid-60s (e.g., 65.87 on 2025-07-22) to the low 30s (e.g., 34.99 on 2025-08-03). While there was a brief rebound, the last recorded RSI is 42.45, which is in the neutral range but indicates weakening momentum and proximity to oversold conditions.

### Volume Analysis
The recent downtrend in price, particularly from late July into August, has been accompanied by fluctuating but generally lower trading volumes compared to earlier periods. Notable volume increases on 2025-07-29 and 2025-08-02 coincided with price declines, suggesting selling pressure. Conversely, recent minor price increases on 2025-08-04 and the first entry for 2025-08-05 occurred on significantly lower volumes, indicating a lack of strong buying conviction. The last data point shows a price decrease with decreased volume, which does not contradict the downtrend.

### Outlook
Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is currently in a clear downtrend, confirmed by the price consistently trading below its key moving averages and the recent bearish EMA/SMA crossover. Momentum is weak, with the RSI hovering near oversold levels. The lack of strong buying volume on recent minor price increases further reinforces the bearish sentiment. The overall technical outlook remains bearish based on the provided data.

## Virtuals protocol
### Trend Analysis
The trend analysis for Virtuals Protocol reveals distinct phases. From late August to early September 2024, the price initially traded above both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA. A 'death cross' occurred around 2024-09-06, as the 13-period EMA (0.03256) crossed below the 21-period SMA (0.0327), signaling the start of a downtrend. This bearish trend persisted until mid-October 2024, with the price generally remaining below both moving averages and the EMA staying below the SMA. A significant 'golden cross' then formed around 2024-10-14, where the 13-period EMA (0.0558) crossed above the 21-period SMA (0.0533). This initiated a strong uptrend that lasted until early January 2025, characterized by the price consistently trading above both moving averages and the EMA maintaining its position above the SMA. However, a 'death cross' re-emerged around 2025-01-10, with the 13-period EMA (3.6813) falling below the 21-period SMA (3.5280). Since this point, the price has largely remained below both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and the EMA has consistently stayed below the SMA, indicating a sustained bearish trend up to the last recorded data point (2025-08-05), where the price (1.2098) is significantly below the EMA (1.3568) and SMA (1.5351).

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Virtuals Protocol has shown significant fluctuations. From late September to early January, the RSI frequently entered and sustained itself in the overbought territory (above 70), reaching extreme levels such as 96.04 on 2024-10-28 and 90.60 on 2024-12-01, indicating very strong bullish momentum during those periods. Following this, from January to mid-March 2025, the RSI generally trended downwards, dipping into oversold territory (below 30) on several occasions, notably reaching 28.95 on 2025-02-03 and 27.21 on 2025-02-08, signaling strong bearish momentum. A brief resurgence in late April to early May saw the RSI again move into overbought levels, peaking at 86.50 on 2025-05-03. More recently, the RSI has been trending downwards, dropping to 28.49 on 2025-08-03 (oversold) before recovering slightly to 34.19 on the last recorded date, indicating a current weak momentum.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Virtuals Protocol has shown strong correlation with significant price movements. During the initial strong uptrend from mid-October to early December 2024, volume experienced massive spikes, notably reaching 10.38 million on 2024-10-17, 63.12 million on 2024-10-26, and an all-time high of 441.69 million on 2024-12-01. These volume surges strongly confirmed the bullish price action, indicating high conviction among market participants. As the price peaked and entered a downtrend in early 2025, volume remained elevated, with a notable spike of 962.95 million on 2025-01-03, which coincided with a significant price decline, suggesting strong selling pressure. Throughout the subsequent downtrend, volume has fluctuated but generally remained substantial, with occasional spikes on both upward price bounces (e.g., 972.48 million on 2025-05-09) and downward movements (e.g., 420.61 million on 2025-05-31), indicating continued market activity and confirmation of selling pressure during declines. The most recent price drop on 2025-08-05 was accompanied by a moderate volume of 116.90 million, which, while not a peak, suggests continued bearish sentiment.

### Outlook
Virtuals Protocol has experienced a significant shift in its technical posture. A strong uptrend characterized by price above moving averages and high RSI values from mid-October 2024 to early January 2025 was well-supported by massive volume spikes. However, since early January 2025, the token has entered a clear downtrend, with price consistently trading below both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and the EMA remaining below the SMA. Momentum indicators, as shown by the RSI, have generally reflected this bearish shift, frequently entering oversold conditions. While there were periods of temporary bullish momentum and price rallies, these were often short-lived within the broader downtrend. The most recent data confirms the continuation of this bearish trend, with price below both moving averages and the RSI in a weak momentum range, albeit having recently bounced from oversold levels. Volume remains substantial but has not consistently supported a reversal of the current downtrend.
