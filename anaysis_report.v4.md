    # NARRATIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
    Emerging Narrative: Decentralized AI and AI Agents

The most significant emerging narrative in the cryptocurrency market is the rapid integration and development of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI Agents. This trend signifies a shift towards building intelligent, autonomous, and verifiable on-chain systems by leveraging blockchain technology.

At its core, this narrative involves the creation of decentralized AI solutions, AI-powered infrastructure, and AI agents that operate within blockchain ecosystems [25, 26, 27, 29, 30]. These systems aim to move beyond traditional centralized AI models, offering enhanced user control, transparency, and new economic paradigms.

Key projects and players driving this narrative include Bittensor (TAO), which is recognized for its innovative approach to decentralized AI and its deflationary tokenomics that incentivize high-quality AI contributions and foster collective intelligence [25, 26]. Other notable projects and tokens are Raiinmaker ($RAIIN), Sapien, Bless Network, Warden Protocol, and $TAIX, all contributing to decentralized intelligence layers and AI utility [17, 21, 25, 27, 28]. New AI agent tokens like $ROBERT, $BNKR (listed on Coinbase), RECALL, $BID, $Nation, and $KIRAI are emerging, positioned as transformative forces for the upcoming crypto bull run by enabling automation and on-chain economies [26, 29, 30]. Projects like Qubic are building Layer 1 blockchains specifically for decentralized AI, while Irys focuses on programmable data for AI and DePIN applications [18, 28].

The primary drivers behind this emerging narrative are multifaceted:

*   **Technological Innovation:** There's a strong emphasis on developing advanced decentralized AI solutions, AI agents, and new tokenomics that provide incentives and foster collective intelligence [25, 26, 29]. Specialized blockchain architectures, including Layer 1s designed for AI and compute layers, are being developed to support this growth [18, 25, 27].
*   **User Control and Decentralization:** A core tenet is empowering users with control over their data, models, and value, moving away from centralized systems. Projects are building infrastructure that is owned and contributed to by users, ensuring transparency and fair rewards [25, 28].
*   **New Economic Models:** AI agents are envisioned as autonomous workers with economic roles, driven by token incentives. This includes the tokenization of AI itself and the creation of marketplaces for agents and datasets, redefining how value is generated and distributed within these ecosystems [25, 29].
*   **Scalability and Efficiency:** The integration of AI with blockchain aims to enhance scalability and efficiency, with efforts to speed up processes and enable verifiable compute through technologies like ZK-proofs [20, 22, 26].
*   **Market Sentiment and Adoption:** There is a strong belief that AI agents will be

### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bittensor (TAO)

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol designed to power a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core objective is to establish a pure market for artificial intelligence, enabling a trustless, open, and transparent environment where consumers and producers of AI can interact. The project aims to address the centralization of AI development and the challenges faced by individual engineers in monetizing their work, by creating an incentivized arena for collaborative machine intelligence production.

### Technology & Use Case
Bittensor's technology revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market where machine learning models collaboratively train and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute. The network employs a sophisticated incentive mechanism to ensure honest participation and resist collusion, even from a significant portion of the network. This mechanism involves peer-ranking, where models evaluate each other, and a consensus function that limits rewards to peers who have not reached consensus. Furthermore, a bond system introduces a speculation-based reward, incentivizing peers to correctly select and bond with other high-value peers. The network also emphasizes tensor standardization, allowing for interoperability between various model types and input modalities (e.g., TEXT, IMAGE, SPEECH), with a roadmap to expand into multi-modality. The compelling use case lies in democratizing AI development, enabling direct monetization for researchers, and providing consumers with direct access to machine intelligence, leveraging globally distributed computing resources.

### Tokenomics
The native token of the Bittensor network is TAO. The total supply and maximum supply are capped at 21,000,000 TAO, with a current circulating supply of 9,466,584 TAO. The tokenomics model is designed to incentivize participation and contribution to the network. High-ranking peers who provide informational value are monetarily rewarded with TAO, which increases their stake in the network. The whitepaper explicitly states that stake (S) increases with the incentive (I), indicating an inflationary mechanism where new TAO tokens are minted and distributed. This distribution is influenced by the bond ownership, meaning peers who have accumulated bonds in other high-performing peers receive increased inflation, encouraging speculative behavior aligned with network value.

### Team & Roadmap
The whitepaper lists Yuma Rao as the author, indicating a key individual behind the project's foundational concepts. However, detailed information regarding the broader team's background or experience is not provided in the fundamental data. The roadmap for Bittensor is clearly articulated, particularly concerning the expansion of its tensor standardization. Initially, the network will be seeded with a single modality (TEXT) and plans to progressively expand to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR modalities. The long-term vision includes integrating combinations of these modalities, such as TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge into a multi-modality landscape, ultimately aiming for models that can accept inputs from any modality and process them into useful representations. This demonstrates a clear and ambitious technical development path.

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective.
- Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- The production of machine intelligence has come to rely almost entirely on a system of benchmarking, where machine learning models are trained to perform well on narrowly defined supervised problems. While this system works well for pushing the performance on these specific problems, the mechanism is weak in situations where the introduction of markets would enable it to excel.
- Standalone engineers cannot directly monetize their work and what results is centralization where a small set of large corporations control access to the best artificial intelligence (OpenAI [2020]).
- TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs.
- This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them.
- The solution is a network of computers that share representations continuously and asynchronously, peer-to-peer (P2P) across the internet. The constructed market uses a digital ledger to record ranks and to provide incentives to peers in a decentralized manner.
- Researchers can directly monetize machine intelligence work and consumers can directly purchase it.
- The solution is an incentive mechanism that maximally rewards honestly selected weights, making the system resistant to collusion of up to 50 percent of the network weight.
- We extended the naive ranking method to evade collusion with an incentive function I ( W , S ) \ I(W, S) \: I ( W , S ) which limits reward to peers that have not reached consensus in the network.
- This consensus described above protects against naive collusion by making it difficult for small groups to achieve inflation. However, it does not provide a incentive for correctly selecting weights. We introduce these incentives by adapting the inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward in the form of bonds B.
- A common encoding of inputs and outputs is required for the various model types and input types to interact. The use of tensor modalities can be used to partition the network into disjoint graphs. At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR.
- total_supply': 21000000.0
- circulating_supply': 9466584.0
- max_supply': 21000000.0
- Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- Our goal is the distribution of stake I , as an incentive, to peers who have helped minimize the loss-objective (Figure-1), and importantly, in such a way that, it is difficult for a small proportion of stake to collude as a means to maximize their distribution in the network without minimizing the loss (Figure-3). (` 1 `) S t + 1 = S t + Ï„ I \ S_{t+1} = S_{t} + \tau I S t + 1 = S t + Ï„ I
- Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves.
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- Yuma Rao 00/ Abstract
- Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.
- Eventually, successful models should accept inputs from any modality and process them into a useful representation.

## Internet computer
### Fundamental Analysis

## Internet Computer (ICP) Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary

Internet Computer (IC), developed by the DFINITY Foundation, is presented as the world's first blockchain capable of operating at web speed with unrestricted capacity. Its core mission is to extend the public internet into a decentralized global computing platform, thereby revolutionizing traditional software services and the crypto economy. The project aims to overcome the significant limitations of smart contracts on conventional blockchains, such as high transaction and storage costs, slow computational speeds, and the inability to serve frontends directly to users. By addressing these issues, IC seeks to enable the creation of fully decentralized applications (dApps) that run entirely on the blockchain, eliminating reliance on centralized cloud providers and single points of failure, thus realizing the vision of Web3.

### Technology & Use Case

The Internet Computer's core technology revolves around a network of cryptographic protocols connecting independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute "canisters," which are the IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters are general-purpose, Turing-complete programs capable of storing data, performing computations, and providing a complete technology stack, including serving web pages directly to end-users. This allows for end-to-end decentralized applications.

The IC employs a "reverse-gas model" where canister developers pre-pay computational and storage costs using "cycles," which are obtained by converting ICP, the native token. This design aims for greater cost-effectiveness, higher throughput, lower latency, and enhanced scalability compared to existing platforms, allowing the network to grow by adding more nodes. The IC supports a range of mutability policies for smart contracts, from immutable to unilaterally upgradable. The network operates under a "partial synchrony communication model" and is designed to tolerate "Byzantine faults" where less than one-third of replicas may be faulty.

ICP, the native utility token, serves three primary roles within the ecosystem:
1.  **Network Governance**: ICP holders can participate in the governance of the Internet Computer network through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called the Network Nervous System (NNS). Voting power is determined by the amount of ICP staked, and governance decisions include network topology changes and protocol upgrades.
2.  **Production of Cycles for Compute**: ICP can be converted into "cycles," which act as transaction fees to access the network's computational resources. These cycles are burned upon use, introducing a deflationary mechanism for the ICP used in this manner.
3.  **Rewarding Users**: ICP is used to incentivize users for their participation in securing and maintaining the network.

The use case for ICP is compelling and essential to the ecosystem. Its dual function as a governance token and the source of "cycles" for computation directly underpins the network's operation and decentralization. The reverse-gas model, where developers pay for computation rather than end-users, is a significant departure from traditional blockchain models and could foster broader adoption by simplifying the user experience.

### Tokenomics

As of the provided data, the Internet Computer has a total supply and circulating supply of approximately 536,225,513.61 ICP tokens. A maximum supply is not explicitly defined, which could imply a potentially uncapped supply, though the whitepaper does not specify this. The economic model incorporates both inflationary and deflationary mechanisms:

*   **Deflationary**: ICP tokens are converted into "cycles" to cover computational and storage costs, and these cycles are subsequently "burned after used." This mechanism reduces the supply of ICP effectively used for network operations.
*   **Inflationary**: ICP is used as a reward for users participating in network governance and for incentivizing network security. This introduces new tokens into circulation.

Regarding distribution, the project has raised a total of $121 million from notable investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital. The launch of the ICP utility token also enabled "tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network," indicating a significant distribution to the community for decentralized governance.

### Team & Roadmap

The Internet Computer project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams and is built by the DFINITY Foundation. The project has secured substantial funding from prominent investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital, indicating strong institutional backing.

A major milestone for the project was the public launch of the Internet Computer on May 10, 2021, which included the release of its source code and the ICP utility token, enabling community governance. The whitepaper, last updated on December 18, 2023 (version 1.4), describes the current state and advanced capabilities of the IC. The project's roadmap is implicitly driven by its decentralized governance model, the Network Nervous System (NNS). The NNS, being PoS-based, allows community members to make decisions regarding the creation of new subnets, the addition or removal of replicas, and software updates, ensuring continuous evolution and upgrades of the protocol based on community consensus. This indicates an ongoing, community-governed development trajectory rather than a fixed, pre-defined roadmap.

### Proof
- Internet Computer (IC) is the worlds first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the worlds computing platform, in a decentralized manner. Internet Computer sets to revolutionalize the design of the crypto economy, with an aim to overhaul traditional software services.
- Smart contracts running on today's blockchain platforms, including all the https://dfinity. org/foundation/ ; contact author: Yvonne-Anne Pignolet, yap@dfinity. 1 popular ones (such as Ethereum), su er from many limitations, such as high transaction and storage costs, slow computational speed, and the inability to serve frontends to users. As a result, many popular blockchain applications are not fully decentralized but are hybrids where most of the application is hosted on traditional cloud platforms and call out to smart contracts on a blockchain for a small part of their overall functionality. Unfortunately, this renders such applications non-decentralized, and opens them to many of the drawbacks of traditional cloud-hosted applications, such as being at the mercy of cloud providers, and being vulnerable to many single points of failure.
- The IC consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that connects independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute \canisters", the IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters can store data, perform very general computations on that data, and provide a complete technology stack, serving web pages directly to end users.
- Computational and storage costs are covered by a \reverse-gas model", where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC. ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol.
- Compared to existing smart contract platforms, the IC is designed to: bemore cost e ective , in particular, allowing applications to compute and store data at a fraction of the cost of previous platforms; provide higher throughput and lower latency for processing smart contract transac- tions; bemore scalable , in particular, the IC can process unbounded volumes of smart con- tract data and computation natively because it can grow in capacity by adding more nodes to the network.
- The IC allows a range of mutability policies for smart contracts, ranging from purely immutable to unilaterally upgradable, with other options in between.
- In addition to providing a smart contract platform, the IC is designed to act as a complete technology stack , such that systems and services can be built that run entirely on the IC. In particular, smart contracts on the IC can service HTTP requests created by end users, so that smart contracts can directly serve interactive web experiences.
- In the IC, the assumption is that if a given subnet has nreplicas, then less than n=3 of these replicas are faulty and these faults may be Byzantine.
- The partial synchrony assumption is only needed to ensure that the consensus protocol makes progress (the so-called liveness property). The partial synchrony assumption is not needed to ensure correct behavior of consensus (the so-called safety property), nor is it needed anywhere else in the IC protocol stack.
- The IC's permission model is a hybrid model , obtaining the e ciency of a permissioned protocol while o ering many of the bene ts of a decentralized PoS protocol. This hybrid model is called a DAO-controlled network
- ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles: 1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI 2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network
- The IC's DAO is called the network nervous system (NNS) , and is based on a PoS, so that all decisions taken by the NNS are made by community members whose voting power is determined by how much of the IC's native governance 5 token they have staked in the NNS (see Section 1. 8 for more on this token).
- total_supply': 536225513.6088883
- circulating_supply': 536225513.6088883
- The project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic WIlliams and have raised a total of $121 million from investors such as Adreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital and such.
- On May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, marking it a major milestone for ICP as it means the internet now functions as a decentralised global computer. This is marked by the release of all of the Internet Computers source code into the public domain, as well as ICP utility token that allows tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network.
- Through this PoS-based governance system, new subnets can be created, replicas may be added to or removed from existing subnets, software updates may be d'.

### Fundamental Analysis


# Fundamental Analysis: Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI)

## Project Summary
The Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance is the world's largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Established in April 2024 through a community-approved tokenomic merger of $AGIX, $FET, and $OCEAN into a single $FET token (now referred to as ASI), the Alliance unites SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, with CUDOS joining as a network member. Its primary goal is to accelerate the advancement of decentralized AGI and ultimately Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) by providing a robust, open-source innovation stack. This initiative aims to empower global developers, enterprises, and researchers to build ethical, scalable, and groundbreaking AI solutions, ensuring advanced intelligence remains a shared, accessible resource beyond centralized systems.

## Technology & Use Case
The ASI Alliance's core technology leverages the combined strengths of its member protocols to create a comprehensive decentralized AI ecosystem. The integration of CUDOS is particularly significant, providing scalable, decentralized computing power crucial for AGI and ASI development.

    *   **Cost-Effective Compute Power:** ASI holders can access and pay for computational resources at competitive rates.
    *   **Expanding the Compute Marketplace:** ASI facilitates a dynamic marketplace for supplying and accessing scalable computing power.
    *   **Staking for Reduced Compute Costs:** Developers can stake ASI to further reduce their compute expenses.

This multi-layered utility makes the ASI token integral to the ecosystem, powering everything from governance and security to AI agent interactions, data monetization, and access to decentralized computing resources. The use case is compelling as it addresses the critical need for scalable, cost-efficient, and decentralized infrastructure for advanced AI development, fostering an open and accessible AI future.

## Tokenomics
The ASI ($FET) token is the foundational utility token of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, resulting from the merger of FET, OCEAN, and AGIX tokens. The tokenomics are structured as follows:

*   **Total Supply:** 2,714,493,896.672 ASI
*   **Circulating Supply:** 2,604,959,126.672 ASI
*   **Max Supply:** 2,714,493,896.672 ASI

The fixed maximum supply suggests a capped token issuance. While the whitepaper mentions a "community-approved tokenomic merger," specific details regarding the distribution percentages for the team, investors, or community are not provided in the given text. The staking mechanism for network security and data farming implies an inflationary aspect through rewards, but specific emission rates are not detailed. There is no explicit mention of deflationary mechanisms like token burning.

## Team & Roadmap
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance was formed by the strategic coalition of SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, with CUDOS joining as a key network member. These are established entities within the blockchain and AI sectors, indicating a foundation built on existing expertise and projects. While individual team members' backgrounds are not detailed in the provided data, the alliance of these prominent projects suggests a strong collective capability.

It aims to solve the challenges of decentralized autonomous systems, particularly the need for standardized protocols for large-scale transactions among independent AI agents and humans. The core problem it addresses is the potential for compounding information loss and lack of standardization in autonomous agent interactions, which hinders the emergence of reliable autonomous businesses. The protocol introduces the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) to secure and streamline information exchange, enabling transparent, verifiable, and tamper-resistant interactions.

### Technology & Use Case
Virtuals Protocol's core technology is the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized framework designed for many-to-many decentralized autonomous systems. ACP leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure and streamlined information exchange. It operates through a four-phase interaction model: Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluation, all implemented via smart contracts. This structured approach ensures clarity, certainty, and verifiability in agent interactions. A crucial aspect of ACP is the integration of 'evaluator agents' that audit and validate transactions, enhancing trust and fostering a new market driven by aligned incentives. The use case is compelling as it provides a foundational layer for autonomous commerce, enabling specialized AI agents to collaborate, negotiate, and transact securely and reliably. The protocol's capability agnosticism allows any entity to participate, making it adaptable for marketplaces with both human and AI agents. The utility of the token is implicitly tied to the economic model for evaluator agents, who receive compensation (a percentage of transaction value) for their services, creating an incentive for high-quality evaluation and potentially driving demand for the native token if used for these fees.

### Tokenomics
The Virtuals Protocol token has a total supply and a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. The current circulating supply is 655,129,888.0885236 tokens. This indicates that approximately 65.51% of the total supply is currently in circulation. The project's market capitalization stands at $1,231,828,027, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $1,880,280,611. The whitepaper mentions an economic model where evaluator agents receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3%) as compensation. While the specific token used for these fees is not explicitly named in the provided text, this mechanism suggests a potential utility and demand driver for the native token within the ecosystem. No explicit details regarding token distribution to the team, investors, or community, nor specific inflationary or deflationary mechanisms (beyond the fee structure), are provided in the available documentation.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided `developer_data` states "Not Listed," meaning information regarding the team's background or specific members is not available in the given data. This lack of transparency regarding the team is a notable point. Regarding the roadmap, the whitepaper outlines future developments for the ACP. It mentions that while version 1 (v1) commits only final agreed-upon terms on-chain for efficiency, subsequent versions could include a summary or record of the entire negotiation process and messages. Furthermore, a key future ambition is for AI evaluators to be able to read, understand, infer, and evaluate all fields from the negotiation thread. The protocol also envisions the emergence of a "Specialized Evaluator Agents Market," where agents trained for specific domains (e.g., software quality, content evaluation) can offer their services, incentivized by the fee structure. This indicates a clear vision for the evolution of the protocol's capabilities and ecosystem.

## Internet computer
### Fundamental Analysis

## Internet Computer (ICP) Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary

Internet Computer (IC) is a blockchain platform developed by the DFINITY Foundation that aims to extend the public internet into a decentralized global computing platform. Its core objective is to enable the creation and hosting of fully decentralized applications (dApps) and services directly on the blockchain, overcoming the limitations of traditional smart contract platforms such as high costs, slow speeds, and the inability to serve front-ends directly to users. The project seeks to revolutionize how software is built and IT systems are maintained, moving away from reliance on centralized cloud providers to realize the vision of Web3.

### Technology & Use Case

The Internet Computer's technology is based on a network of interacting replicated state machines, which host and execute "canisters"â€”its form of smart contracts. These canisters are general-purpose, Turing-complete programs capable of storing data, performing computations, and serving web pages directly to end-users, effectively acting as a complete technology stack. The IC employs a "reverse-gas model," where canister developers pre-pay computational and storage costs in cycles, which are obtained by converting ICP tokens. This design aims to provide higher throughput, lower latency, and greater scalability compared to existing smart contract platforms, allowing for unbounded volumes of smart contract data and computation by adding more nodes to the network. The IC also supports a range of mutability policies for smart contracts, offering flexibility for upgrades and bug fixes.

The native token, ICP, is essential to the ecosystem and serves three prominent roles:
1.  **Network Governance**: Users stake ICP to participate in the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), known as the Network Nervous System (NNS), which governs the network, determines topology changes, and approves protocol upgrades. Participants are rewarded with ICP for their involvement.
2.  **Production of Cycles for Compute**: ICP can be converted into "cycles," which act as transaction fees to access and utilize the network's computational and storage resources. Cycles are burned after use.
3.  **Rewarding Users**: ICP is used to incentivize users for participating in and securing the network.

The use case for ICP is compelling as it directly underpins the operational mechanics and governance of the Internet Computer. Without ICP, the network cannot function, as it provides the means for computational resources (cycles) and enables decentralized governance, which are fundamental to the project's vision of a truly decentralized internet.

### Tokenomics

As of the provided data, the Internet Computer has a circulating supply of 536,225,513.61 ICP tokens, which also represents the total supply. There is no specified maximum supply. The project has a market capitalization of $2,759,455,449 and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $2,759,455,449, indicating that the circulating supply is currently equal to the total supply. The economic model incorporates both inflationary and deflationary mechanisms. Inflation occurs through the distribution of ICP as rewards for network governance and participation. Deflation is introduced by the burning of "cycles" (derived from ICP) used as transaction fees for computation and storage on the network. The project raised a total of $121 million from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital.

### Team & Roadmap

The Internet Computer project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams and is developed by the DFINITY Foundation. The project has attracted significant investment from notable venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital, indicating strong backing from established players in the blockchain space. The public launch of the Internet Computer and the release of its source code occurred on May 10, 2021, marking a major milestone. While a detailed future roadmap with specific timelines is not explicitly provided in the given data, the project's ambition is clearly defined: to "recreate the web," "extend the public internet," and "overhaul traditional software services" by building a decentralized global computer. The continuous development is evidenced by the whitepaper version 1.4, dated December 18, 2023, suggesting ongoing protocol enhancements and feature implementations. The governance by the Network Nervous System (NNS) implies a community-driven evolution of the platform.

### Proof
- Internet Computer (IC) is the worlds first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the worlds computing platform, in a decentralized manner. Internet Computer sets to revolutionalize the design of the crypto economy, with an aim to overhaul traditional software services.
- Smart contracts are a new form of software that will revolutionize how software is written, IT systems are maintained, and applications and whole businesses are built. Smart contracts are composable and autonomous pieces of software that run on decen- tralized blockchains, which makes them tamperproof and unstoppable. In this paper, we describe the Internet Computer (IC), which is a radical new design of blockchain that unleashes the full potential of smart contracts, overcoming the limitations of smart contracts on traditional blockchains with respect to speed, storage costs, and compu- tational capacity. This allows smart contracts for the rst time to implement fully decentralized applications that are hosted end to end on blockchain.
- The IC consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that connects independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute \canisters", the IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters can store data, perform very general computations on that data, and provide a complete technology stack, serving web pages directly to end users.
- Computational and storage costs are covered by a \reverse-gas model", where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC.
- ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol.
- Compared to existing smart contract platforms, the IC is designed to: bemore cost e ective , in particular, allowing applications to compute and store data at a fraction of the cost of previous platforms; provide higher throughput and lower latency for processing smart contract transac- tions; bemore scalable , in particular, the IC can process unbounded volumes of smart con- tract data and computation natively because it can grow in capacity by adding more nodes to the network.
- The IC allows a range of mutability policies for smart contracts, ranging from purely immutable to unilaterally upgradable, with other options in between.
- ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles: 1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI 2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network

## Bitcoin
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bitcoin

### Project Summary
Bitcoin is presented as the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology, designed to enable online payments directly between parties without the need for a central bank or financial institution. It aims to solve the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model prevalent in traditional internet commerce, such as the need for trusted third parties, transaction costs, and the possibility of transaction reversals. The core problem it addresses is double-spending in a digital currency system without relying on a central authority, achieving this through a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions into an unchangeable chain of hash-based proof-of-work.

### Technology & Use Case
Bitcoin's core technology is a decentralized peer-to-peer network utilizing cryptographic proof instead of trust. It employs a proof-of-work system, specifically using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, where nodes expend CPU effort to find a hash that meets a certain difficulty, thereby securing blocks. Transactions are chained together using digital signatures, and the network maintains a public, chronological order of transactions through a distributed timestamp server. The longest chain, representing the most proof-of-work effort, is considered the valid history. To save disk space, transactions within blocks are hashed in a Merkle Tree, with only the root included in the block's hash. The primary utility of the Bitcoin token (BTC) is to serve as electronic cash, allowing secure, verifiable, and immutable transfers with low transaction fees and protection of identity. It facilitates direct peer-to-peer payments, avoiding mediation costs and enabling non-reversible transactions. The use case is compelling as it provides a novel solution to digital cash, offering independence from central authorities and addressing issues like fraud and high transaction costs associated with traditional systems.

### Tokenomics
Bitcoin is designed to have a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC. The current circulating supply is 19,896,128.0 BTC, which also represents the total supply. The initial distribution of coins into circulation is achieved through an incentive mechanism where the creator of a new block receives a special transaction (block reward) of newly minted coins. This is analogous to gold miners expending resources (CPU time and electricity) to add gold to circulation. In addition to block rewards, transaction fees also contribute to the incentive for nodes to support the network. Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary currency due to its fixed maximum supply. The whitepaper states that 

### Proof
- Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency.
- The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way.
- It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.
- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
- We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
- What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.
- The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
- Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes.
- To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof- of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
- The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits.
- Transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
- Bitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- total_supply: 19896128.0
- circulating_supply: 19896128.0
- By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
- The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
- The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.
- Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
- It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.
- The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.

Ethereum is a global, open-source platform designed for decentralized applications. Its core vision is to function as a "world computer" where anyone can build decentralized applications, with all states and data being distributed and publicly accessible.

## Technology & Use Case
Ethereum's core technology supports smart contracts, allowing developers to program digital value through code. This capability enables a wide array of decentralized applications (dapps), including tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges. The native coin of the blockchain, Ether (ETH), is essential for all transactions and smart contract executions on the network. These operations require a fee, known as "Gas," which measures the computational effort needed. Gas fees are paid entirely in ETH, making the token integral to the network's functionality and usage. The price of gas fluctuates based on network demand.

## Tokenomics
As of the provided data, Ethereum has a total supply of 120,711,314.2989037 ETH, which also represents its circulating supply. There is no explicit maximum supply stated, nor is it indicated as infinite, suggesting a dynamic supply model not capped at a specific number. The provided data does not detail the distribution of ETH among the team, investors, or community, nor does it specify any explicit inflationary or deflationary mechanisms beyond the dynamic gas fee structure.

## Team & Roadmap

## Bnb
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of BNB

### Project Summary
BNB, or Binance Coin, is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance platform, which operates as a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name "Binance" itself is a portmanteau of "binary" and "finance," signifying its focus on crypto-to-crypto trading. The platform has achieved significant global success, characterized by a substantial daily trading volume. BNB aims to serve as a utility token within the Binance ecosystem, offering various benefits to its users.

### Technology & Use Case
Initially launched as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB has evolved to become the native asset of the BNB Chain, functioning as a Layer 1 (L1) smart contract platform utilizing a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Its primary utility within the Binance ecosystem revolves around fee payments. Users can utilize BNB to pay for various fees on the Binance platform, including trading fees, transaction fees, and listing fees. A key incentive for using BNB is a tiered discount schedule on these fees, which gradually decreases over five years. This structure is designed to encourage the purchase and use of BNB for trading activities. Beyond fee discounts, BNB is also designated to be used as "gas" within the Binance ecosystem, implying its role in powering transactions and smart contract executions on the BNB Chain.

### Tokenomics
BNB has a maximum supply capped at 200 million tokens. The initial distribution of BNB was structured as follows: 50% was allocated for the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), 40% was reserved for the team, and 10% was distributed to Angel investors. The current total and circulating supply of BNB are both 139,288,816.25 tokens. A significant deflationary mechanism for BNB is its buyback and burn program. Binance announced a plan to buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018, with the intention of burning these coins. This burning process permanently removes tokens from circulation, aiming to increase the value of the remaining tokens and benefit investors.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not offer specific details regarding the background of the BNB development team or a comprehensive future roadmap. While the description mentions that the cryptocurrency "will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas" in the future, this is a general statement rather than a detailed strategic plan. Developer activity metrics indicate a historical presence with 2,054 forks, 4,170 stars, and 55 pull requests merged by 26 contributors. However, recent activity over the last four weeks shows no new code additions, deletions, or commits, and zero open or closed issues, suggesting a lack of recent public development updates in the provided data.

### Proof
- Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the Binance platform. It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name "Binance" is a combination of binary and finance. Thus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other.
- The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1. 5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.
- The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. The schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12. 5% discount, fourth year 6. 75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.
- Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum
- categories: Smart Contract Platform, Exchange-based Tokens, BNB Chain Ecosystem, Centralized Exchange (CEX) Token, Layer 1 (L1), Proof of Stake (PoS)
- In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.
- In total, there will only be 200 million BNBs.
- Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors.
- total_supply: 139288816.25
- circulating_supply: 139288816.25
- max_supply: 200000000.0
- Binance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors.

## Bittensor
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bittensor

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol that establishes a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core objective is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, where machine learning models collaborate, train, and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute. This system aims to facilitate a trustless, open, and transparent environment for the interaction between consumers and producers of AI, while also allowing external users to access and influence the network's activities.

### Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Bittensor revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market. Unlike traditional AI development which often leads to centralization and narrow specialization, Bittensor proposes a framework where machine intelligence is measured and valued by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for their informational production, irrespective of the specific task or dataset used for training. This approach allows for the monetization of diverse and niche AI systems, fostering innovation and decentralizing access to artificial intelligence.

TAO, the native token, serves as the primary utility within the Bittensor ecosystem. It is used to reward peers (machine learning models) for their contributions to minimizing the network's loss objective, effectively incentivizing the production of valuable intelligence. TAO also grants external access, enabling users to extract information from the network and tune its operations to their specific needs. The whitepaper details an incentive mechanism designed to prevent collusion, ensuring that rewards are primarily directed towards honest contributions. This mechanism involves peer-ranking, a consensus function that rewards highly trusted peers, and a bond system where peers accumulate bonds in others they rank, speculating on their future value. The network ensures consensus by adjusting the number of weights miners set, directing inflation towards peers with majority consensus.

### Tokenomics
The Bittensor network has a `total_supply` and `max_supply` of 21,000,000 TAO tokens. The `circulating_supply` is 9,466,584 TAO. The tokenomics model is designed to incentivize contributions to the network. High-ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network, and stake (TAO) is distributed as an incentive to peers who help minimize the network's loss objective. The system incorporates an inflationary mechanism where new TAO is minted and distributed based on bond ownership and contributions to the network, with peers who accurately speculate on the future value of other peers receiving increased inflation. This continuous distribution of newly minted stake ensures ongoing incentives for participation and value creation within the decentralized intelligence market.

### Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the specific team members and their backgrounds is not explicitly provided in the available documentation, beyond the whitepaper author, Yuma Rao. However, the project's roadmap, as outlined in the whitepaper, focuses on the expansion and standardization of tensor modalities. Initially, the network is seeded with a single modality, TEXT. The plan is to progressively expand to include other modalities such as IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR, and eventually combinations like TEXT-IMAGE to bridge into a multi-modality landscape. The roadmap also highlights the integration of incentives to connect these modalities using the existing trust scaling mechanism, with the ultimate goal for successful models to accept and process inputs from any modality into a useful representation. This indicates a clear vision for the technological evolution and functional diversification of the Bittensor network.

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective. TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs. Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- We propose a market where intelligence is priced by other intelligence systems peer-to-peer across the internet.
- The production of machine intelligence has come to rely almost entirely on a system of benchmarking, where machine learning models are trained to perform well on narrowly defined supervised problems... what results is centralization where a small set of large corporations control access to the best artificial intelligence (OpenAI [2020]).
- A new commodity needs a new type of market... This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them.
- The constructed market uses a digital ledger to record ranks and to provide incentives to peers in a decentralized manner. The chain measures trust, making it difficult for peers to attain rewards without providing value to the majority. Researchers can directly monetize machine intelligence work and consumers can directly purchase it.
- Our goal is the distribution of stake I , as an incentive, to peers who have helped minimize the loss-objective (Figure-1), and importantly, in such a way that, it is difficult for a small proportion of stake to collude as a means to maximize their distribution in the network without minimizing the loss (Figure-3).
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- total_supply: 21000000.0
- circulating_supply: 9466584.0
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- Our goal is the distribution of stake I , as an incentive, to peers who have helped minimize the loss-objective (Figure-1)...
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.
- Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves.
- At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.
- Incentives to connect modalities can be integrated with the same trust scaling suggested in section (` 2 `). Eventually, successful models should accept inputs from any modality and process them into a useful representation.

## Render

### Proof
- The Render Network is a leading decentralized GPU compute platform for applications ranging from 3D rendering to machine learning and generative AI.
- The network connects node operators looking to monetize their idle GPU compute power with artists and developers looking to scale intensive 3D rendering work and machine learning applications in the cloud.
- Computational infrastructure is a major bottleneck in producing next generation media, which requires exponentially more computing power than what is available in the centralized GPU cloud.
- There is a competition for resources within the centralized GPU cloud - from GPU rendering and cloud streaming to AI training - leading to availability constraints and prohibitively expensive pricing for many artists.
- Meanwhile most artists GPUs remain idle when they are not rendering their own work, or are out of use after upgrading to new GPU models, reducing the productivity potential of existing local GPU infrastructure.
- The Render Network is a blockchain-based global rendering platform where GPU work is utilized to trace digital photons and help create next generation 3D content.
- Node operators with idle compute power can contribute their unused GPUs to a global network and earn RNDR for processing artists rendering needs, creating a more efficient use of GPU infrastructure.
- OctaneBench is a proprietary benchmarking tool (and the most popular benchmark for GPU rendering used today) that measures GPU rendering speeds, measured in OctaneBench Points per Hour (OBh), which in turn determines the pricing of rendering tasks.
- The cost for any task is measured in OctaneBench and is determined by a Multi-Tier Pricing (MTP) algorithm.
- Reputation Scoring: As Node Operators successfully complete jobs on the network, they build trust needed to receive a higher volume of jobs. ... Creators build reputation scores by successfully using the network.
- Use Cases and Applications: The Render Network can be used by artists, engineers, designers, and developers for a wide range of GPU workloads and applications, enabling new forms of creative, scientific, and industrial production that would be cost prohibitive on local infrastructure or centralized services.

## Immutable
### Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Immutable is a blockchain project focused on enhancing the scalability and efficiency of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum network. It operates the Immutable X network, which is identified as "the first zk-rollup for NFT on Ethereum." The project primarily targets the gaming industry, encompassing GameFi and Play-to-Earn models, aiming to provide a robust Layer 2 solution for NFT-related transactions.

### Technology & Use Case
The core technology behind Immutable X is a Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-rollup), a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This technology allows for off-chain processing of transactions, significantly reducing gas fees and increasing transaction throughput for NFTs, while inheriting the security of the Ethereum mainnet. This makes Immutable X particularly well-suited for high-volume applications such as blockchain games and NFT marketplaces. The IMX token serves as the native token for the Immutable X network, indicating its integral role within the ecosystem, although its specific utilities (e.g., for fees, staking, or governance) are not detailed in the provided data. The project's strong categorization within "Gaming (GameFi)", "Play To Earn", "NFT", and "Gaming Blockchains" underscores a compelling use case in a sector that heavily relies on efficient and cost-effective NFT infrastructure.

### Tokenomics
The IMX token has a defined maximum supply of 2,000,000,000 tokens. Its total supply currently stands at 2,000,000,000.0 tokens, with a circulating supply of 1,890,903,648.3898141 tokens. This high circulating supply relative to the total and maximum supply suggests a significant portion of tokens are already released into the market. The project's market capitalization is $1,194,167,129, and its fully diluted valuation is $1,263,065,022. The close alignment between market cap and FDV further supports the observation of a high circulating supply.

## Zcash
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Zcash

### Project Summary
Zcash is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to provide privacy and selective transparency for transactions. It aims to solve the problem of public visibility inherent in traditional blockchains like Bitcoin by allowing users to keep transaction details (sender, recipient, and amount) private, while still publishing the transaction on a public ledger.

### Technology & Use Case
Zcash's core technology leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically zero-knowledge proofs known as zk-SNARKs. These proofs enable the network to verify the validity of encrypted transactions without revealing any sensitive information about them. The project builds upon Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase, enhancing it with this privacy feature. Zcash offers flexibility to its users by supporting both 'shielded' (private) and 'transparent' (public) transactions. Users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly, and even mix these transaction types, for instance, sending from a transparent address to a shielded address to protect the receiving value. The primary use case is private digital payments, which is compelling for individuals and entities seeking confidentiality in their financial dealings on a blockchain.

### Tokenomics
The Zcash token (ZEC) has a `total_supply` of approximately 16.20 million ZEC and a `circulating_supply` of approximately 16.20 million ZEC. The `max_supply` is capped at 21 million ZEC, mirroring Bitcoin's supply cap. This fixed maximum supply suggests a disinflationary model, where the rate of new token issuance decreases over time until the cap is reached. The provided data does not detail specific distribution mechanisms (e.g., team, investor, community allocations) or explicit inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond the supply cap.

## Starknet
### Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Starknet is a decentralized Layer 2 (L2) validity rollup designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability. It achieves this by utilizing cryptographic protocols known as STARKs, aiming to expand Ethereum's capacity without compromising its core tenets of decentralization, transparency, inclusivity, and security. It functions as an infrastructure and smart contract platform within the Ethereum and broader Layer 2 ecosystem.

### Technology & Use Case
Starknet's core technology is its implementation as a permissionless, decentralized Layer 2 validity rollup, leveraging STARKs to scale Ethereum. The primary use case for the Starknet Token is integral to the operation, maintenance, and security of its ecosystem, as well as directing its strategic evolution. The token's utility is clearly defined across three essential functions: (i) governance, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making; (ii) payment of transaction fees on the Starknet network; and (iii) participation in Starknet's consensus mechanism. These utilities make the token's role compelling and essential for the network's functionality and decentralized governance.

### Tokenomics
The Starknet Token has a total supply and a maximum supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens. The current circulating supply is 3,835,684,730.35 tokens. The token's utility is foundational to the Starknet ecosystem, serving as the medium for governance, transaction fee payments, and participation in the network's consensus mechanism. With a fixed maximum supply, the token's design does not inherently suggest an inflationary model beyond its initial distribution.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not include specific information regarding the background of the Starknet team or a detailed roadmap outlining future developments and milestones. While developer activity metrics are available, such as forks, stars, subscribers, pull requests merged, and code additions/deletions, these do not constitute a comprehensive roadmap or provide insights into the team's specific expertise or past achievements.

# Technical Analysis Reports
## Bittensor
### Trend Analysis
The price of Bittensor has been in a clear downtrend in the latter part of the provided data. The price has consistently traded below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the most recent period. A significant death cross occurred around 2025-07-31, where the 13-period EMA (406.14) crossed below the 21-period SMA (412.52), signaling a bearish shift in the trend. As of the last data point (2025-08-04), the price (355.528) remains well below both the EMA (378.808) and SMA (404.933), with the EMA also positioned below the SMA, reinforcing the prevailing bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has been in a declining trend, moving from 59.67 on 2025-07-28 down to 34.11 on 2025-08-03, indicating weakening momentum. On the last day, 2025-08-04, the RSI showed a slight rebound to 41.63. All recent RSI values remain within the neutral range (30-70), not indicating overbought or oversold conditions, though it was approaching the oversold threshold before the recent rebound.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume has shown varied patterns, generally confirming the recent bearish price action. Significant volume spikes were observed on days when the price declined, such as on 2025-07-29 (volume 165.09M) and 2025-08-02 (volume 185.63M), which confirms the conviction behind the downward movements. However, the most recent price increase on 2025-08-04 occurred on a relatively lower volume (81.81M) compared to recent high-volume down days, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support the rebound.

### Outlook
Bittensor is currently in a bearish technical posture. The price is trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and a recent death cross (EMA falling below SMA) further confirms this downtrend. Momentum has been weakening, with the RSI trending downwards, although it has seen a minor rebound from near oversold levels. The recent price decline was largely confirmed by increased selling volume, while the latest minor price increase occurred on decreased volume, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction. The overall outlook remains bearish as long as the price stays below the key moving averages and volume does not strongly support upward movements.

## Near protocol
### Trend Analysis
The price of NEAR Protocol has recently shifted to a bearish trend. On 2025-08-01, the 13-period EMA (2.7357) crossed below the 21-period SMA (2.7567), forming a 'death cross,' which is typically a bearish signal. Following this crossover, the price (2.4447) has consistently remained below both the EMA (2.6134) and the SMA (2.7423) in the last few data points, confirming the established downtrend. Prior to this, a bullish phase was observed in May 2025, where the EMA crossed above the SMA on 2025-05-11 (EMA 2.6239 > SMA 2.5185), and price generally traded above both moving averages until late July.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has been on a declining trend from the mid-60s in late July, dropping into the upper 30s and low 40s in early August. As of the last data point (2025-08-04), the RSI is at 42.81, which is within the neutral range (30-70). The recent decline in RSI indicates a loss of upward momentum.

### Volume Analysis
Analysis of trading volume reveals a confirmation of the recent price depreciation. Significant volume spikes were observed during periods of notable price decline, such as on 2025-07-24 (volume ~415M) and 2025-08-02 (volume ~352M), which saw sharp drops in price. Conversely, the most recent slight price increase on 2025-08-04 occurred on significantly lower volume (101M), suggesting that the upward movement lacks strong buying conviction and may not be sustainable. This pattern indicates that selling pressure has been more dominant and confirmed by higher trading activity.

### Outlook
NEAR Protocol is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The recent death cross, with the EMA falling below the SMA, signals a shift to a downtrend. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has weakened considerably from previously higher levels and remains in the neutral range, leaning towards the lower end. Furthermore, the volume analysis suggests that recent price declines were accompanied by significant selling pressure, while any attempts at recovery have been on comparatively lower volume, indicating a lack of strong buying conviction. This combination of indicators points to continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.

## Internet computer
### Trend Analysis
Internet Computer is currently in a bearish trend. The price (5.1225) is trading below both its 13-period EMA (5.3596) and its 21-period SMA (5.5767).

Since this crossover, the price has largely remained below both moving averages, confirming the established downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI is currently at 42.83, indicating that Internet Computer is in a neutral range. Over the past few days, the RSI has shown a declining trend, moving from around 50 to the high 30s before a slight rebound to its current level. This suggests weakening momentum, although it has not yet entered oversold territory.

### Volume Analysis
Recent volume analysis indicates that selling pressure has been confirmed by increased volume during periods of price decline, such as on July 29, 2025, and August 2, 2025. Conversely, minor price increases, like the one observed on August 4, 2025, have been accompanied by significantly lower trading volume (34,084,572.85), suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction and a potential for further downward movement.

### Outlook
The technical analysis for Internet Computer indicates a prevailing bearish outlook. The price is consistently trading below both its EMA and SMA, reinforced by a recent death cross. Momentum, as shown by the RSI, is neutral but has been trending downwards, signaling weakening buying interest. Volume analysis further supports this bearish sentiment, with price declines often accompanied by increased selling activity and recent minor price increases occurring on diminishing volume, suggesting a lack of conviction from buyers. Overall, the combined signals point towards continued downward pressure.

## Artificial superintelligence alliance
### Trend Analysis
The overall trend for Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is bearish. The price has consistently traded below both the 13-period EMA and the 21-period SMA in the latter part of the data series. A significant death cross occurred on 2025-07-30, where the 13-period EMA (0.74249) crossed below the 21-period SMA (0.74870). This crossover confirms the shift to a bearish trend, with the price remaining below both moving averages since then.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has been in the neutral range throughout the provided data. It showed a declining trend from July 28th (RSI 52.178) to August 3rd (RSI 34.996), moving closer to oversold territory. On August 4th, the RSI slightly rebounded to 39.946, still within the neutral zone. The asset has not entered overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) territory during this period.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis reveals mixed signals but generally supports the recent downtrend. On 2025-07-29, a notable price drop from 0.7556 to 0.7153 was accompanied by increased volume (194.88M), indicating strong selling pressure. Similarly, on 2025-08-02, a price decline to 0.6378 was confirmed by a volume spike (147.12M). However, the most recent price increase on 2025-08-04, from 0.6166 to 0.6435, occurred on significantly lower volume (60.30M), suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction and potential weakness in the upward movement.

### Outlook
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance token is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The price is consistently trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and a death cross occurred on July 30th, where the EMA crossed below the SMA, reinforcing the downtrend. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is neutral but has shown a clear downward trajectory, suggesting weakening buying interest. Volume analysis further supports this bearish sentiment, with significant selling pressure observed during recent price declines, while the most recent price rebound occurred on notably low volume, indicating a lack of strong bullish conviction.

## Virtuals protocol
### Trend Analysis
The price of Virtuals Protocol has been in a sustained downtrend since early June 2025. This is clearly indicated by the price consistently trading below both the 13-period EMA and the 21-period SMA. A significant bearish crossover, commonly known as a Death Cross, occurred on 2025-06-05, where the EMA (2.005) crossed below the SMA (2.007). This crossover has been maintained, with the current price (1.2128) significantly below both the EMA (1.4010) and SMA (1.5775) on 2025-08-04, reinforcing the strong bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Virtuals Protocol has been trending downwards, recently touching oversold territory at 28.49 on 2025-08-03. It has since rebounded slightly to 32.91 on 2025-08-04, placing it in the lower end of the neutral range. This indicates weak momentum, though the slight rebound from oversold conditions could suggest a potential for short-term price stabilization or a minor bounce.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Virtuals Protocol has shown varying patterns during the recent downtrend. While some price declines were accompanied by relatively high volume (e.g., 2025-07-30 and 2025-08-02, where price decreased and volume increased), suggesting conviction in selling, the most recent price increase on 2025-08-04 (from 1.1540 to 1.2128) was accompanied by a notable decrease in volume (from 116.4M to 79.4M). This lack of volume confirmation for the recent upward price movement suggests limited buying interest and a potential lack of conviction in the short-term price rebound.

### Outlook
Virtuals Protocol is currently in a clear downtrend, evidenced by the price trading below both its EMA and SMA, and the recent bearish crossover (Death Cross). While the RSI briefly entered oversold territory before a slight recovery, indicating weak momentum, the most recent price increase was not supported by significant volume, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction. The overall technical outlook remains bearish, with potential for continued downward pressure unless stronger buying interest emerges, confirmed by increasing volume.

## Iotex
### Trend Analysis
IoTeX is exhibiting a clear uptrend. The price is consistently trading above both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Specifically, the latest price of 0.0289 is above the EMA of 0.02648 and the SMA of 0.02506. Furthermore, the EMA has been above the SMA since approximately June 4, 2025, and has continued to widen its lead, confirming a sustained bullish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for IoTeX has recently moved into overbought territory, with the latest reading at 70.77. This indicates strong buying pressure in the very short term. The RSI significantly surged from neutral levels (around 47-48) on July 29-30, 2025, to enter the overbought zone by August 1, 2025, and has largely remained there.

### Volume Analysis
The recent sharp increase in price from July 30, 2025 (0.0227) to July 31, 2025 (0.0267) was accompanied by a massive volume spike from 8.27 million to 83.18 million, strongly confirming the upward price movement. While the price continued to rise in the following days (to 0.0289 by August 4, 2025), the trading volume has progressively decreased from its peak (49.60 million, 54.36 million, 23.75 million, and 14.52 million), suggesting that the conviction behind the most recent price advances may be waning compared to the initial surge.

### Outlook
IoTeX is currently in a clear uptrend, as evidenced by the price trading above both its EMA and SMA, and the EMA maintaining a position above the SMA. The recent price surge was initially confirmed by a significant spike in trading volume, indicating strong conviction behind the move. However, the subsequent days have seen decreasing volume despite continued price appreciation, which could suggest a slight weakening of buying conviction on the latest price increases. The momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is currently in overbought territory, suggesting that the asset may be due for a consolidation or pullback in the near term.

## Chainlink
### Trend Analysis
Chainlink's price action shows a shift to a bearish trend. A significant death cross occurred on 2025-08-02, where the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossed below the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Since this crossover, the price has consistently traded below both the EMA and SMA, with the EMA (17.085) now below the SMA (17.754) as of the last data point on 2025-08-04, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Chainlink has been trending downwards from near overbought levels (approaching 70) in late July, moving into the neutral range. The most recent RSI values are 46.29 and 49.51 on 2025-08-04, indicating that momentum has shifted from bullish to a more neutral stance. While there was a slight uptick in the last two data points, the overall trend in momentum has been bearish since late July.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Chainlink saw a significant spike on 2025-08-02, reaching over 1 billion, which coincided with a notable price drop from 16.9475 to 16.1001. This high volume on a down move confirms strong selling pressure and conviction behind the recent price decline. Subsequent days (2025-08-03 and 2025-08-04) have seen substantially lower volumes, even with slight price increases, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support any upward movement following the large sell-off.

### Outlook
Chainlink is currently in a bearish trend, as indicated by the recent death cross and price trading below key moving averages. Momentum has shifted to neutral after a period of decline from overbought conditions. The recent significant price drop was confirmed by high selling volume, while subsequent minor price increases have lacked strong buying conviction. The technical outlook suggests continued caution, with a need for sustained buying volume to reverse the established bearish trend.

## Internet computer
### Trend Analysis
Internet Computer experienced a clear uptrend from mid-June to late July, evidenced by the price consistently trading above its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA. A golden cross, where the 13-period EMA crossed above the 21-period SMA, occurred around 2025-06-10, reinforcing the bullish trend. However, in the most recent period, the trend has reversed. The price has fallen below both moving averages, and a death cross, where the 13-period EMA (5.600) crossed below the 21-period SMA (5.636), was observed on 2025-07-31. As of 2025-08-04, the price (5.1225) remains below both the EMA (5.3596) and SMA (5.5767), indicating a bearish shift in the short-term trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI indicates a shift in momentum. It reached an overbought level of 70.78 on 2025-07-22, signaling strong upward momentum. However, it subsequently declined sharply, moving into the neutral range and currently stands at 42.83 as of 2025-08-04. The recent trend in RSI has been predominantly downward from its overbought peak, suggesting a loss of bullish momentum.

### Volume Analysis
During the uptrend from mid-June to late July, rising prices were generally confirmed by increasing trading volume, with notable spikes such as the 182.58 million on 2025-06-10. This indicated strong conviction behind the upward movement. However, as the price began to decline from 2025-07-23 onwards, significant volume accompanied these drops (e.g., 117.39 million on 2025-07-24 and 101.24 million on 2025-07-29), confirming the bearish price action. The most recent price increase on 2025-08-04 was on comparatively lower volume (34.08 million), suggesting a lack of strong buying interest to support a sustained rebound.

### Outlook
Internet Computer has recently transitioned from a strong uptrend to a downtrend. The price is now trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, confirmed by a recent death cross. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has cooled significantly from overbought conditions and is now in a neutral range with a declining trajectory. While recent bearish price movements were supported by notable volume, the latest minor price rebound occurred on comparatively low volume, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction. The overall technical outlook points to a prevailing bearish sentiment in the short term.

## Filecoin
### Trend Analysis
The price of Filecoin has been in a clear downtrend in the latter half of the provided data. After a period of upward movement and consolidation, the price broke below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA around late October/early November 2024. A death cross, where the EMA crossed below the SMA, occurred around November 14, 2024. Since then, the price has consistently traded below both moving averages, with the EMA remaining below the SMA, indicating a sustained bearish trend. The most recent data points show the price at 2.3837, well below the EMA of 2.4774 and the SMA of 2.6169, confirming the ongoing downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Filecoin has shown significant fluctuations throughout the data. After reaching overbought levels (above 70) in early December 2024 and again briefly in mid-May 2025 (70.72 on 2025-05-11), it has since declined. In late January/early February 2025, the RSI dipped into oversold territory (below 30), indicating strong selling pressure. More recently, from late May onwards, the RSI has mostly remained in the lower half of the neutral range (30-70), frequently approaching or dipping below 40. The latest RSI reading of 42.41 on 2025-08-04 indicates that momentum is currently neutral but leaning bearish, having recently moved up from lower levels.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Filecoin has been highly dynamic. Periods of significant price increases in late 2024 were confirmed by exceptionally high trading volumes, with multiple days exceeding 1 billion. Conversely, the sharp price declines in late 2024 and early 2025 were also accompanied by substantial volume, indicating strong selling conviction. More recently, during the sustained downtrend from mid-May 2025, volume has generally been lower than the peaks but still shows notable spikes on days with significant price drops (e.g., 2025-05-31, 2025-06-06, 2025-06-14, 2025-06-23, 2025-07-24, 2025-08-02). This suggests that selling pressure remains active and is confirmed by volume, even as overall trading activity has somewhat normalized from its previous highs. The most recent daily volume (99.20M) is moderate and accompanies a slight price increase after a period of decline.

### Outlook
Filecoin is currently in a clear downtrend, as evidenced by the price consistently trading below both its EMA and SMA, with the EMA remaining below the SMA. This bearish trend is further supported by the RSI, which, despite a recent slight uptick, remains in the lower neutral range, indicating weak buying momentum. Volume analysis shows that significant price movements, both up and down, have historically been confirmed by high trading activity. While recent volumes are not as extreme as previous peaks, notable spikes on down days confirm continued selling pressure. The overall technical outlook for Filecoin, based on the provided data, is bearish, with price action and moving averages indicating a sustained downward trajectory, and momentum indicators not yet showing strong signs of a reversal.

## Chutes
### Trend Analysis
In the initial period where both moving averages are available (from 2025-06-26), the price of Chutes was consistently below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with the EMA also below the SMA (e.g., on 2025-06-26, price was 58.88, EMA 70.19, SMA 77.98), indicating a clear downtrend. A significant bullish shift occurred around mid-July; on 2025-07-16, the price (73.57) surged above both the EMA (57.35) and SMA (54.43). Concurrently, the EMA crossed above the SMA on the same day, forming a golden cross, signaling a potential uptrend. However, this uptrend was brief. By 2025-07-29, the EMA (61.54) crossed back below the SMA (61.97), forming a death cross, indicating a resumption of the downtrend. Towards the end of the data, the price (e.g., 45.71 on 2025-08-04) remains significantly below both the EMA (50.89) and SMA (59.35), with the EMA also well below the SMA, confirming a strong and persistent bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Chutes began in oversold territory (below 30) in late June (e.g., 28.72 on 2025-06-22). It then fluctuated in the lower neutral range, frequently approaching oversold conditions again in early July (e.g., 28.69 on 2025-07-08). A significant surge in momentum was observed from July 10th to July 18th, with the RSI rising sharply to the mid-60s (e.g., 65.72 on 2025-07-16, 65.96 on 2025-07-18), indicating strong bullish momentum, though it did not enter overbought territory (>70). Following this peak, the RSI has steadily declined, re-entering oversold territory from July 31st to August 3rd (e.g., 29.81 on 2025-08-01, 27.47 on 2025-08-03). The last two data points on August 4th show a slight rebound in RSI (32.35 and 34.09), moving just above the oversold threshold but still indicating weak momentum.

### Volume Analysis
The initial price decline from mid-June to early July saw mixed volume, with some higher volumes on down days (e.g., 7.09M on 2025-06-18 during a minor price drop), suggesting selling interest. The notable price surge from 2025-07-09 to 2025-07-16 was strongly confirmed by a significant increase in trading volume, culminating in a peak volume of 7.13M on 2025-07-16, which coincided with the price reaching its highest point in this period. This indicates strong buying conviction during the brief upward move. Following this peak, as the price began its subsequent decline from 2025-07-19, volume generally decreased initially, suggesting a lack of strong selling conviction. However, towards the end of the data, the continued price depreciation from 2025-07-28 to 2025-08-04 is accompanied by several notable volume spikes (e.g., 2.80M on 2025-07-28, 4.58M on 2025-07-31, 5.82M on 2025-08-02, and 4.81M/4.47M on 2025-08-04), indicating renewed and strong selling pressure that confirms the recent downtrend.

### Outlook
Chutes has experienced a significant bearish trend throughout much of the provided data. While there was a brief bullish reversal in mid-July, marked by a golden cross and strong volume, this proved to be short-lived. The subsequent death cross in late July, combined with the price consistently trading below both the EMA and SMA, firmly re-established a strong downtrend. The RSI has recently re-entered oversold territory, indicating persistent bearish momentum. Furthermore, recent price declines have been accompanied by notable spikes in selling volume, confirming the conviction behind the downward movement. The overall technical outlook for Chutes is currently strongly bearish, with no clear signs of an immediate reversal based on the provided data.

## Targon
### Trend Analysis
Targon's price has been in a notable downtrend in the latter half of the provided data. From 2025-07-30 onwards, the price consistently traded below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). A significant bearish crossover occurred around 2025-08-01/2025-08-02, where the 13-period EMA (25.2994 on 2025-08-01) fell below the 21-period SMA (26.2534 on 2025-08-01), and this relationship has persisted to the last data point (EMA 23.0895 vs SMA 25.4928 on 2025-08-04), reinforcing the bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Targon was in a neutral range (above 50) until 2025-07-29. On 2025-07-30, the RSI sharply declined from 53.10 to 41.25, indicating a significant loss of bullish momentum. It continued to fall, entering the oversold territory (<30) on 2025-08-03 with a value of 29.32. While the RSI has since slightly recovered to 34.63 on the last data point (2025-08-04), it remains in the lower end of the neutral range, suggesting continued weak momentum and a lack of strong buying pressure.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis reveals a significant spike on 2025-07-29 (5.66 million) which coincided with a slight price increase, followed by a sharp price decline on 2025-07-30 accompanied by high volume (1.14 million), indicating strong selling pressure. Subsequently, as the price continued its downward trajectory or consolidated at lower levels, the trading volume generally decreased, with the last few days showing relatively low volumes (e.g., 187K and 249K on 2025-08-04). This suggests that the recent downtrend is not being met with strong buying interest, and the lack of increasing volume on the slight price rebound on 2025-08-04 indicates a lack of conviction for a reversal.

### Outlook
Targon is currently exhibiting a clear bearish technical outlook. The price has firmly established a downtrend, consistently trading below its key moving averages, which themselves have formed a bearish crossover. Momentum is weak, having recently dipped into oversold conditions, and the subsequent slight recovery lacks conviction. While the initial sharp decline was on high volume, indicating strong selling, the subsequent lower volumes during price consolidation/further decline suggest a lack of significant buying interest to reverse the trend. The combined signals point towards continued bearish pressure.

## Bittensor
### Trend Analysis
The price of Bittensor has been in a clear downtrend. From 2025-07-29 onwards, the price has consistently traded below both the 13-period EMA and the 21-period SMA. A significant bearish crossover occurred recently on 2025-07-30, when the 13-period EMA (411.66) crossed below the 21-period SMA (411.35). This bearish alignment of the moving averages, with the EMA remaining below the SMA in subsequent days (e.g., 378.80 EMA vs 404.93 SMA on 2025-08-04), confirms the prevailing downward trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has been in a declining trend, moving from 50.23 on 2025-07-29 to a low of 34.11 on 2025-08-03. On 2025-08-04, the RSI saw a slight rebound to 41.63. Throughout the observed period, the RSI has remained within the neutral range (between 30 and 70), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis shows varied activity. A notable increase in volume occurred on 2025-08-02 (185.6M) as the price continued its decline, suggesting strong selling pressure. However, the most recent price increase on 2025-08-04 was accompanied by a decrease in volume (81.8M) compared to previous days, indicating a lack of strong buying conviction to support the upward price movement.

### Outlook
Bittensor is currently in a bearish technical phase, as indicated by the price trading below both its EMA and SMA, and the recent bearish crossover of the EMA below the SMA. Momentum is subdued, with the RSI trending downwards, although it has shown a minor rebound from recent lows. The volume analysis suggests that recent price declines were accompanied by significant selling interest, while the latest price increase lacks strong buying conviction due to decreasing volume. The overall outlook remains cautious, with no strong signals for a reversal of the current downtrend.
