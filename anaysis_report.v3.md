    # NARRATIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
    Emerging Narrative: The Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Decentralized Technologies

The most significant emerging narrative in the cryptocurrency market is the profound convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with decentralized technologies, encompassing AI agents, decentralized AI networks, and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). This trend is driven by a collective effort to build more transparent, community-owned, and efficient AI systems, challenging the traditional centralized models dominated by "Big Tech" [929, 911].

At its core, this narrative envisions an "agent-driven internet" where AI agents perform diverse functions, from autonomous wealth creation and data access to trading and verifying token legitimacy [1013, 990, 1002]. These agents are powered by a new class of AI-related tokens that serve as fuel, provide utility within their ecosystems, or reward community participation [999, 915, 922, 940]. Projects like Bittensor (TAO) are pioneering decentralized AI, leveraging token incentives to foster collective intelligence and scalable solutions, with its token designed for deflationary pressure and long-term value growth driven by increasing AI demand [276, 931, 256]. Other tokens like $ROBERT, $XAI, $COOKIE, and $ALLO are also emerging as foundational elements for decentralized intelligence and autonomous AI backbones [935, 930, 939, 940].

A crucial component of this convergence is the rise of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). DePIN projects are highlighted as key to next-generation Web3, enabling real-world utility and machine economies by decentralizing physical assets and compute resources [954, 966]. They are increasingly integrated with AI, focusing on decentralized AI coordination and compute layers [962]. Projects like Bless Network are noted for utilizing idle devices to create a "global shared computer" that powers AI, DeFi, and gaming, offering significant cost savings compared to centralized alternatives like AWS [970, 280, 282, 960]. Ankr and Irys also contribute to this infrastructure, building decentralized Web3 and AI/DePIN applications [972, 971]. The sentiment is that DePIN is moving beyond a niche concept towards broader adoption, providing verifiable on-chain revenue and transparent infrastructure [966, 989].

Technological advancements are a primary driver, with new Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions being developed to support AI integration. Qubic, for instance, is a Layer 1 aiming to integrate decentralized AI and potentially surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin [750]. Monad, an EVM Layer 1, focuses on parallel execution for high transaction throughput, suitable for real-time games and complex DeFi strategies, and is seen as building AI-native chains [752, 742]. INFINIT Launcher is emerging with an AI-powered operating layer to simplify crypto development and DeFi [799, 858]. The integration of AI is reshaping strategies across Web3, enhancing experiences and extending blockchain's reach beyond traditional finance [255, 832].

The market recognizes the transformative potential of AI agents, with a Coinbase listing of an AI agent token ($BNKR) signaling regulatory edge and market potential [1015]. The overall sentiment suggests that AI agents will be a "game-changer" in the upcoming crypto bull run, driving automation and new applications [1013]. This narrative emphasizes user control, community ownership, and the vision of "AI by the people, for the people," contrasting sharply with centralized AI models [923, 929].

## Internet computer
### Fundamental Analysis

## Internet Computer (ICP) Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
The Internet Computer (IC) is presented as the world's first blockchain capable of running at "web speed" with "unrestrictive capacities." Developed by the DFINITY Foundation, its core mission is to decentralize and extend the public internet, aiming to become a global computing platform. The project seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional smart contract platforms, such as high costs, slow speeds, and limited computational capacity, by enabling fully decentralized applications (dapps) to be hosted end-to-end on the blockchain. It aims to provide a complete technology stack, allowing services to be built without reliance on corporate cloud hosting or private servers, thereby realizing the vision of Web3 by restoring the internet's open and innovative roots.

### Technology & Use Case
The Internet Computer's core technology revolves around "canisters," which are its form of smart contracts. These canisters are general-purpose, Turing-complete programs that can store data, perform computations, and directly serve web pages to end-users, acting as a complete technology stack. The IC operates as a network of interacting replicated state machines, organized into subnets, each running a permissioned consensus protocol. However, the overall network governance is decentralized through a hybrid "DAO-controlled network" model, specifically the Network Nervous System (NNS), which is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based DAO. This allows for efficiency while maintaining decentralization. Smart contracts on the IC can have a range of mutability policies, from immutable to unilaterally upgradable, offering flexibility for developers.

The ICP token is essential to the ecosystem and serves three primary roles:
1.  **Network Governance:** ICP holders can stake their tokens in the NNS to participate in governance, voting on network changes, topology, and protocol upgrades, and are rewarded for their participation.
2.  **Production of Cycles for Compute:** ICP can be converted into "cycles," which act as transaction fees to access and utilize the network's computational and storage resources. Cycles are burned upon use, creating a deflationary pressure on the ICP supply used for computation.
3.  **Rewarding Users:** ICP is used to incentivize users for participating in and securing the network.

The use case for ICP is compelling as it directly underpins the operational mechanics and governance of the Internet Computer. Without ICP, developers cannot pay for compute and storage, and the network cannot be governed or secured by its community, making the token integral to the platform's functionality and decentralization.

### Tokenomics
The Internet Computer's native token is ICP. The current circulating supply is 536,225,513.61 ICP, which is also reported as the total supply. There is no specified maximum supply, indicating that the token model allows for potential inflation, primarily through rewards for network governance and participation. However, a key deflationary mechanism is the conversion of ICP into "cycles" for computational and storage costs, which are then burned. This "reverse-gas model" means developers pre-pay costs, and the cycles are consumed, effectively removing ICP from circulation when used for network resources. The governance system, the Network Nervous System (NNS), is based on Proof-of-Stake, where community members stake ICP to gain voting power, further locking up supply.

### Team & Roadmap
The Internet Computer project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams. The project successfully raised a significant $121 million from notable investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital, indicating strong institutional backing. A major milestone was achieved on May 10, 2021, when the DFINITY Foundation launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, releasing its source code and the ICP utility token for community governance. The whitepaper, updated on December 18, 2023, suggests ongoing development and documentation. The roadmap, as implied by the project's vision, is ambitious: to transform the internet into a decentralized global computer, enabling fully decentralized applications and services without reliance on traditional cloud providers. The NNS governance system further outlines a continuous roadmap driven by community proposals for creating new subnets, adding/removing replicas, and implementing software updates, demonstrating a commitment to decentralized evolution and growth.

### Proof
- Internet Computer (IC) is the worlds first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the worlds computing platform, in a decentralized manner.
- The Internet Computer (IC), which is a radical new design of blockchain that unleashes the full potential of smart contracts, overcoming the limitations of smart contracts on traditional blockchains with respect to speed, storage costs, and computational capacity. This allows smart contracts for the rst time to implement fully decentralized applications that are hosted end to end on blockchain.
- Compared to existing smart contract platforms, the IC is designed to: bemore cost e ective , in particular, allowing applications to compute and store data at a fraction of the cost of previous platforms; provide higher throughput and lower latency for processing smart contract transac- tions; bemore scalable , in particular, the IC can process unbounded volumes of smart con- tract data and computation natively because it can grow in capacity by adding more nodes to the network.
- In addition to providing a smart contract platform, the IC is designed to act as a complete technology stack , such that systems and services can be built that run entirely on the IC. In particular, smart contracts on the IC can service HTTP requests created by end users, so that smart contracts can directly serve interactive web experiences. This means that systems and services can be created without relying on corporate cloud hosting services or private servers, thus providing all of the bene ts of smart contracts in a true end-to-end fashion. Realizing the vision of Web3.
- These blockchains host and execute \canisters", the IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters can store data, perform very general computations on that data, and provide a complete technology stack, serving web pages directly to end users.
- Computational and storage costs are covered by a \reverse-gas model", where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC. ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol.
- ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles: 1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI 2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network
- To a rst approximation, the IC is a network of interacting replicated state machines. The notion of a replicated state machine is a fairly standard concept in distributed systems [Sch90], but we give a brief introduction here, beginning with the notion of a state machine.
- The IC's permission model is a hybrid model , obtaining the e ciency of a permissioned protocol while o ering many of the bene ts of a decentralized PoS protocol. This hybrid model is called a DAO-controlled network and (roughly speaking) works as follows: each subnet runs a permissioned consensus protocol, but a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) determines which entities provide replicas, con gures the topology of the network, provides a public-key infrastructure, and controls which version of the protocol is deployed to the replicas. The IC's DAO is called the network nervous system (NNS) , and is based on a PoS, so that all decisions taken by the NNS are made by community members whose voting power is determined by how much of the IC's native governance 5 token they have staked in the NNS (see Section 1. 8 for more on this token).
- The IC allows a range of mutability policies for smart contracts, ranging from purely immutable to unilaterally upgradable, with other options in between.

## Artificial superintelligence alliance
### Fundamental Analysis


### Project Summary
The Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance is described as the "worlds largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)." Formed in April 2024, it unifies SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol, with CUDOS later joining as a network member. The Alliance was established through a community-approved tokenomic merger, combining the $AGIX, $FET, and $OCEAN tokens into a single unified token, $FET (now referred to as ASI). Its primary objective is to accelerate the advancement of decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), by providing a robust, open-source innovation stack to build ethical, scalable, and groundbreaking AI solutions, thereby ensuring advanced intelligence remains a shared, accessible resource beyond centralized systems. The integration of CUDOS specifically addresses the critical demand for scalable decentralized computing power, which is essential for advancing beyond narrow AI towards human-cognition-matching models.

### Technology & Use Case
The core technology of the ASI Alliance revolves around building a "disruptive AGI technology stack that seamlessly integrates multiple computing paradigms and orchestrates heterogeneous compute nodes within a decentralized network." A significant technological enhancement comes from CUDOS's distributed cloud compute model, which aims to reduce bottlenecks, single points of failure, and enhance security by decentralizing data storage. This infrastructure is designed to support continuous learning, adaptation, and the integration of vast amounts of data for evolving AGI systems.

The ASI ($FET) token serves as the "essential utility token that drives the blockchain-powered, decentralized AI economy forward." Its utility is multi-layered and appears compelling and essential for the ecosystem:
*   **Layer 1 Utility**:
    *   **Governance**: Token holders can participate in on-chain governance, proposing and voting on critical decisions, ensuring community-driven evolution.
    *   **Staking**: ASI tokens are used in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model to secure the Fetch.ai (ASI) mainnet, with stakers earning rewards for contributing to network security and consensus.
    *   **Security**: The PoS model, underpinned by ASI, ensures robust network security through a decentralized network of validators.
*   **Inherited and Expanded Utilities**:
    *   **Ocean Protocol - Data Farming**: ASI expands on Ocean Protocol's data monetization framework, allowing staking to create data pools and enabling data providers to earn rewards.
    *   **SingularityNET - AI Marketplace Access**: ASI becomes the native token for accessing a wide range of AI services and products within the marketplace, streamlining transactions.
    *   **Fetch.ai - Agent Search and Discovery**: ASI powers the agent registration and discovery mechanisms within the Fetch.ai (ASI) network, enhancing discoverability of AI agents.
*   **CUDOS Integration Utilities**:
    *   **Cost-Effective Compute Power**: ASI token holders can access and pay for decentralized computational resources at competitive rates, crucial for resource-intensive AI applications.
    *   **Expanding the Compute Marketplace**: ASI fosters a dynamic compute marketplace where users can supply and access affordable, scalable computing power.
    *   **Staking for Reduced Compute Costs**: Developers can stake ASI to further reduce their compute costs, democratizing access to high-performance computing.

The use case is highly compelling as the token is fundamental to every aspect of the Alliance's operations, from governance and security to enabling access to crucial AI services, data, and, critically, decentralized compute resources needed for advanced AI development.

### Tokenomics
The ASI token has a defined supply structure:
*   **Total Supply**: 2,714,493,896.672 ASI
*   **Circulating Supply**: 2,604,959,126.672 ASI
*   **Max Supply**: 2,714,493,896.672 ASI
The `max_supply_infinite` field is null, confirming a fixed maximum supply.

The tokenomic model primarily involves the consolidation of $AGIX, $FET, and $OCEAN into a single $FET (ASI) token. While the whitepaper mentions staking rewards for validators and data providers, which can introduce inflationary pressure through new issuance, it does not detail specific token distribution percentages for the team, investors, or community. No explicit deflationary mechanisms like token burning are mentioned in the provided text.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not offer specific details on individual team members' backgrounds. However, the project is a merger of established entities: SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS. This implies a collective of experienced teams from these respective projects are behind the Alliance.

The roadmap, while not presented as a phased timeline, is ambitious and clearly articulated in its strategic objectives:
*   **Advancing AGI and ASI**: The core ambition is to "accelerate the advancement of decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)."
*   **Sovereign Compute**: A key future direction is the establishment of "sovereign computeâ€”computational resources owned and controlled by the suppliers to the compute network, free from reliance on external providers," ensuring autonomy and resilience.
*   **Democratization of AI**: A central pillar is the "democratization of access to open infrastructure," aiming to prevent technological lock-in and foster innovation by distributing vital AI tools equitably.
*   **Evolving Use Cases**: The ASI token is positioned to be "central to emerging use cases, positioning both community members and developers at the forefront of creating, deploying, and monetizing next-generation AI technologies," including compound AI systems and AGI/ASI frameworks.

The clarity of the roadmap lies in its strategic vision and the identified critical components (like decentralized compute via CUDOS) necessary to achieve its ambitious goals, rather than specific short-term deliverables. The focus is on building a robust, decentralized infrastructure for the future of AI.

## Virtuals protocol
### Fundamental Analysis

# Project Summary
Virtuals Protocol is an AI x Metaverse protocol focused on building the future of virtual interactions. It addresses the challenges of large-scale, decentralized commerce for autonomous AI agents by introducing the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP). ACP is a standardized, framework-agnostic protocol that leverages blockchain technology to enable safe, secure, and verifiable transactions between independent AI agents and humans, facilitating the emergence of "autonomous businesses."

# Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Virtuals Protocol is the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a blockchain-based framework designed for many-to-many decentralized autonomous systems. ACP defines a four-phase interaction modelâ€”Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluationâ€”implemented via smart contracts. Key principles guiding ACP include framework and capability agnosticism, atomic interactions with defined entry/exit conditions, deterministic outcomes, and cryptographically verifiable agreements, ensuring transparency, immutability, and trust.

The primary use case for Virtuals Protocol is to standardize and streamline autonomous agent commerce. It allows specialized AI agents to collaborate, negotiate, and transact securely, overcoming issues like information loss and lack of interoperability in current digital commerce landscapes. A compelling aspect is the enablement of a specialized market for "evaluator agents" who audit and validate transactions, enhancing trust and providing quality assessment. The protocolâ€™s design supports both AI and human agents, making it adaptable for evolving digital marketplaces.

The utility of the token within the ecosystem is tied to compensation and fees. The protocol specifies that "Compensation: Price and compensation terms with precise token or currency specifications" are part of the negotiation phase. Furthermore, in the Evaluation Phase, it states that "evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or set value part of the contract agreement) as compensation for their services." This indicates the token is used for payments and incentivizing participants, particularly evaluator agents, which is essential for the protocol

### Proof
- 'An AI x Metaverse Protocol that is building the future of virtual interactions'
- 'To address these challenges, we present the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized framework designed for many-to-many decentralized autonomous systems. ACP leverages blockchain technology to secure and streamline information exchange while introducing a four-phase interaction model - Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluation - implemented via smart contracts.'
- 'The emergence of such agents and autonomous systems in digital commerce and society necessitates standardized protocols for conducting transactions at a large scale. The landscape for commerce and regular everyday transactions lacks standardization, is centralized or makes assumptions about participant capabilities (either humans only or autonomous systems only), limiting interoperability and adoption. This paper presents the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP). ACP addresses these challenges by providing a framework and system agnostic protocol that Preprint. defines the fundamental phases and requirements for safe, secure and verifiable autonomous agent commerce, by building on the strengths of the blockchain beyond just payments.'
- 'ACP is constructed upon four fundamental principles that govern its design and implementation. These principles ensure the protocols flexibility, reliability, and broad applicability across different autonomous systems. Commerce and transactions should be safe, secure, trustable and verifiable. But it should not be more complicated than necessary. Framework and Capability Agnosticism. This principle establishes that the protocol makes no assumptions about the internal implementation of participating entities. This deliberate design choice enables any system, regardless of its underlying architecture or capabilities, to participate in the protocol as long as it adheres to the specified interaction patterns. A decentralized solution has to be framework and capability agnostic. This principle mandates that each phase within the protocol must have explicitly defined entry and exit conditions. This atomicity ensures that transactions cannot exist in intermediate or undefined states, providing clarity and certainty about the interaction and transactions progress at any given moment. The defined states also fully align with agentic principles where states should be clearly defined at any moment to enable agents to best make decisions on what should be done next. Deterministic Outcomes and Single Source of Truth. Outcome-based principle establishes that each phase must have clearly defined success and failure conditions. This deterministic nature ensures that all participants can independently arrive at the same conclusion about a phases status, eliminating ambiguity and reducing the potential for disputes. This principle requires that agreements within the protocol must be cryptographically verifiable. This verification requirement creates an immutable audit trail of the transactions progres- sion and agreed terms. This ensures that all participants can independently validate the state of any transaction. Importantly for autonomous agents, this also means that any participant can securely recall and retrieve past transactions and past terms.'
- 'Specialized Evaluator Agents Market. The protocol enables the emergence of a sophisticated marketplace for specialized evaluator agents. These agents can be developed and trained for specific domains and use cases, such as: Software quality assessment agents specialized in code review and performance testing Content evaluation agents trained for specific creative works and digital assets This specialization allows for highly accurate and domain-specific evaluations, improving the overall quality of transactions within the network.'
- 'Compensation: Price and compensation terms with precise token or currency specifications'
- 'To ensure sustainable operation of high-quality evaluator agents, the protocol enables implementation of a fee structure where evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or set value part of the contract agreement) as compensation for their services.'

## Bittensor
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bittensor

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol designed to establish a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, enabling a trustless, open, and transparent environment where consumers and producers of AI can interact. The project aims to solve the problem of centralized AI development and monetization, allowing individual engineers to directly monetize their work and fostering a more diverse and accessible landscape for machine intelligence.

### Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Bittensor revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market. Machine learning models, or 'peers', train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO based on the informational value they contribute. Peers rank each other by training neural networks to learn the value of their neighbors, with scores accumulating on a digital ledger. The protocol incorporates an incentive mechanism that rewards honestly selected weights and is designed to be resistant to collusion, provided no single group holds more than 50% of the network's stake. A 'bonds' mechanism further incentivizes correct weight selection by allowing peers to speculate on the future value of other peers. The TAO token is essential for the ecosystem, serving as the reward mechanism for valuable contributions and granting external users access to extract information and tune network activities. The use case is compelling as it addresses the centralization of AI development and aims to create a more open and monetizable environment for machine intelligence, with a clear roadmap for expanding into various data modalities (text, image, speech, and combinations thereof).

### Tokenomics
The Bittensor network has a total supply and max supply of 21,000,000 TAO tokens. The circulating supply is currently 9,466,584 TAO. The tokenomics model is inherently inflationary through its reward mechanism. High-ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network, and stake (S) is updated based on an incentive (I) function. Bonds (B) accumulate similarly to token inflation, and the chain distributes newly minted stake into the network based on bond ownership. This system incentivizes active participation and value contribution to the machine learning network.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not contain specific information regarding the Bittensor team's background or individual members. However, the whitepaper outlines a clear and ambitious roadmap for the network's technological expansion. Initially, the network will be seeded with a single modality, TEXT. The plan is to subsequently expand to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR modalities. Furthermore, the roadmap envisions the integration of multi-modality combinations, such as TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into a broader multi-modality landscape. This phased approach to integrating diverse data types demonstrates a forward-looking and comprehensive development strategy for the platform.

## Filecoin
### Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that aims to create a global market for data storage. It allows anyone to participate as storage providers, fostering a competitive environment where the price of storage is determined by supply and demand rather than corporate pricing. This positions Filecoin as a key infrastructure project within the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) and storage categories, operating as a Layer 1 blockchain.

### Technology & Use Case
Filecoin's core technology facilitates a decentralized storage market. Its primary use case is to provide a robust, global, and competitive marketplace for data storage, effectively commoditizing hard-drive space. By enabling anyone to become a storage provider, the network aims to drive down storage costs and increase reliability through competition among miners based on factors like reputation and price. This use case is compelling as it addresses the need for decentralized, censorship-resistant, and potentially more cost-effective data storage solutions, which are essential for the broader Web3 ecosystem and beyond.

### Tokenomics
Filecoin has a maximum supply of 1,959,191,068 tokens. The total supply currently matches the maximum supply at 1,959,191,068.0 tokens. As of the provided data, the circulating supply is 683,251,554.0 tokens. This indicates that approximately 34.87% of the total/max supply is currently in circulation. The project's market capitalization is $1,960,685,261, with a fully diluted valuation of $5,622,170,968. Information regarding the token's distribution (e.g., allocation to team, investors, community) and specific inflationary or deflationary mechanisms is not available in the provided data.

### Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the Filecoin team's background and the project's future roadmap is not available in the provided fundamental data. Developer activity metrics, such as forks, stars, subscribers, total issues, closed issues, pull requests merged, pull request contributors, code additions/deletions, and commit counts over the last four weeks, are all reported as zero or null, suggesting that this specific dataset does not contain recent or comprehensive developer activity metrics for the project. Additionally, no link to a whitepaper was provided, which typically contains details on the team and roadmap.

### Proof
- The Filecoin network achieves staggering economies of scale by allowing anyone worldwide to participate as storage providers. It also makes storage resemble a commodity or utility by decoupling hard-drive space from additional services. On this robust global market the price of storage will be driven by supply and demand, not corporate pricing departments, and miners will compete on factors like reputation for reliability as well as price

## Bittensor
### Fundamental Analysis

## Bittensor: Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol that establishes a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Its core vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, enabling a trustless, open, and transparent environment for consumers and producers of AI. In this network, machine learning models collaborate in training and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute to the collective. TAO also facilitates external access, allowing users to extract information and influence network activities.

### Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Bittensor revolves around a peer-to-peer intelligence market. Unlike traditional benchmarking systems that often lead to centralization and narrow specialization in AI development, Bittensor proposes a framework where machine intelligence is measured and rewarded by other intelligence systems. This allows for the monetization of diverse and niche AI systems, fostering innovation and distributing rewards to contributors. The network utilizes a digital ledger to record ranks and provide incentives in a decentralized manner.

**Key Mechanisms:**
*   **Peer-Ranking:** Peers use the outputs of others as inputs to themselves and learn a set of weights, which are then submitted to the digital ledger. This process measures the value of signals produced by peers.
*   **Incentive Mechanism (Collusion Resistance):** The system is designed to be resistant to collusion. An incentive function limits rewards to peers who have not reached consensus, meaning peers can only attain inflation by attracting votes from the majority. This mechanism assumes that no single group holds more than 50% of the network's stake.
*   **Bonds:** To incentivize correct weight selection, Bittensor introduces a speculation-based reward system called 

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective. TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs. Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them. By changing the basis against which machine intelligence is measured, (` 1 `) the market can reward intelligence that is applicable to a much larger set of objectives, (` 2 `) legacy systems can be monetized for their unique value, and (` 3 `) smaller diverse systems can find niches within a much higher resolution reward landscape.
- The solution is a network of computers that share representations continuously and asynchronously, peer-to-peer (P2P) across the internet. The constructed market uses a digital ledger to record ranks and to provide incentives to peers in a decentralized manner. The chain measures trust, making it difficult for peers to attain rewards without providing value to the majority.
- In this paper, we suggest this can be achieved through peer-ranking, where peers use the outputs of others F ( x ) = [ f 0 ( x ). f n ( x ) ] \ F(x) = [f_{0}(x). f_{n}(x)] \: F ( x ) = [ f 0 ( x ). f n ( x )] as inputs to themselves f ( F ( x ) ) \ f(F(x)) \: f ( F ( x )) and learn a set of weights W = [ w i , j ] \ W = [w_{i,j}] \: W = [ w i , j ] where peer i is responsible for setting the i th row through transactions on a digital ledger.
- We extended the naive ranking method to evade collusion with an incentive function I ( W , S ) \ I(W, S) \: I ( W , S ) which limits reward to peers that have not reached consensus in the network. Assuming no group of peers holds more than the majority of stake in the system, then peers can only attain inflation by working to attract votes from the majority: a core assumption in many decentralized systems like Bitcoin.
- We introduce these incentives by adapting the inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward in the form of bonds B.
- Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves. Thus it makes sense for peers to accumulate bonds in peers which it expects to do well according to other peers with stake in the system - thus speculating on their future value.
- A common encoding of inputs and outputs is required for the various model types and input types to interact. The use of tensor modalities can be used to partition the network into disjoint graphs. At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.
- The chain measures loss and optionally distributes newly minted stake into the network Î” S \ \Delta S \: Î” S according to the bond ownership.

## Bitcoin
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Bitcoin

### Project Summary
Bitcoin is presented as the first successful internet money leveraging peer-to-peer technology, designed to operate without a central bank or authority. Its primary aim is to establish an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof rather than trust, facilitating direct online payments between parties without the need for financial institutions. This addresses the inherent weaknesses of traditional trust-based models, such as mediation costs, the impossibility of truly non-reversible transactions, and the double-spending problem.

### Technology & Use Case
Bitcoin's core technology is built upon a decentralized peer-to-peer network that utilizes cryptographic proof. Transactions are timestamped by hashing them into an ongoing chain, secured by a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, specifically using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This PoW mechanism acts as a 

### Proof
- Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency.
- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
- What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.
- It still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
- We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
- The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
- Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.
- Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes.
- Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.
- To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.
- It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.
- The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way.
- It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.
- By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
- The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.
- Bitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- total_supply: 19896128.0
- circulating_supply: 19896128.0
- Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
- It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.
- The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.
- The steps to run the network are as follows: 1)New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. 2)Each node collects new transactions into a block. 3)Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block. 4)When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. 5)Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent. 6)Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

## Ethereum
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis of Ethereum

## Project Summary
Ethereum is a global, open-source platform designed for decentralized applications. Its core vision is to function as a "world computer," enabling anyone to build applications in a decentralized manner, with all states and data being distributed and publicly accessible.

## Technology & Use Case
Ethereum's core technology revolves around smart contracts, allowing developers to program digital value through code. The platform supports a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), including tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, lending platforms, and decentralized exchanges. The native coin of the blockchain, Ether (ETH), serves as the essential utility token. All transactions and smart contract executions on the Ethereum network require a fee, known as "Gas," which must be paid entirely in ETH. The amount of Gas required is directly proportional to the computational effort of an operation, and its price fluctuates based on network demand. Ethereum operates on a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

## Tokenomics
The total supply and circulating supply of Ether (ETH) are both approximately 120,711,314.29. The provided data indicates that there is no specified maximum supply for ETH, nor is it explicitly stated as infinite. The primary utility of ETH within the network is to pay for "Gas" fees, which are required for all transactions and smart contract executions. The mechanism of how these fees impact the token supply (e.g., burning or redistribution) is not detailed in the provided information beyond stating they are paid in ETH.

## Team & Roadmap
Specific details regarding the core team's background and a comprehensive future roadmap are not available in the provided fundamental data. However, the project demonstrates significant and ongoing developer activity, which is a strong indicator of a healthy and evolving ecosystem. Key metrics from developer data include a substantial number of forks (19,618), stars (44,422), and subscribers (2,195). Over the last four weeks, there have been 41 commits, with 23,340 code additions and 2,460 deletions, and 906 pull request contributors, indicating active development and community engagement.

### Proof
- Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.
- the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible.
- Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value.
- Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.
- On Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. This fee is paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain.

## Bnb
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of BNB

### Project Summary
BNB, or Binance Coin, is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance platform, a prominent trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name "Binance" itself is a portmanteau of "binary" and "finance," indicating its focus on crypto-to-crypto trading pairs rather than fiat currencies. The platform has achieved significant success, boasting a daily trading volume between 1.5 billion and 2 billion US dollars, and operates with its headquarters in Malta.

### Technology & Use Case
Initially, BNB was an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Its primary utility lies within the Binance ecosystem, where it serves multiple functions. Users can utilize BNB to pay various fees on the Binance platform, including trading fees, transaction fees, and listing fees. A key incentive for using BNB is the tiered discount structure offered on these fees: 50% in the first year, 25% in the second, 12.5% in the third, and 6.75% in the fourth, with no discount from the fifth year onwards. This structure is designed to encourage users to acquire and use BNB for their trading activities on Binance. Looking ahead, BNB is intended to remain a core asset on the trading platform and will also be used as "gas" for transactions within its ecosystem, likely referring to the BNB Chain.

### Tokenomics
BNB has a maximum supply capped at 200 million tokens. The initial distribution of BNB was as follows: 50% was sold during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), 40% was allocated to the team, and 10% was distributed to Angel investors. A significant deflationary mechanism is in place through a buyback and burn program. Binance announced a plan in Q1 2018 to buy back and burn up to 100 million BNB, effectively reducing the total supply to increase the value of the remaining coins, which benefits investors. As of the provided data, the circulating supply and total supply are both 139,288,816.25 BNB, indicating that the token burn mechanism has been actively reducing the initial maximum supply.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not offer specific details regarding the background of the Binance team or a comprehensive future roadmap. While the description mentions a past buyback plan in Q1 2018 and a general future intention for BNB to be used as "gas" and remain an asset on the trading platform, it lacks explicit information on upcoming developmental milestones, partnerships, or detailed strategic plans.

### Proof
- Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the Binance platform.
- It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies.
- The name "Binance" is a combination of binary and finance. Thus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat.
- The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters.
- The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1. 5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.
- Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum
- The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others.
- Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB.
- The schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12. 5% discount, fourth year 6. 75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.
- In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.
- In total, there will only be 200 million BNBs.
- Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors.
- Binance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors.

## Gala
### Fundamental Analysis

# GALA Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
GALA is the native token designed to power the Gala Games ecosystem. The project aims to reimagine gaming to benefit both creators and players, focusing on a decentralized approach to game development and ownership.

## Technology & Use Case
GALA operates within a broad ecosystem that includes Smart Contract Platform capabilities, Gaming (GameFi), NFTs, and functions as a Layer 1 (L1) solution. It is part of the Ethereum Ecosystem and has its own GalaChain Ecosystem. The primary utility of the GALA token is to serve as the foundational currency and utility token within the Gala Games platform, enabling transactions, rewards, and potentially other functionalities that support the "play-to-earn" model and benefit creators and players.

## Lido staked ether
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Lido Staked Ether (stETH)

### Project Summary
Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a liquid staking token that represents staked Ether (ETH) within the Lido protocol. The primary problem stETH aims to solve is the illiquidity associated with staking ETH on the Ethereum 2.0 (now Consensus Layer) beacon chain. By holding stETH, users can earn staking rewards without locking their ETH, thereby maintaining liquidity and enabling participation in various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols.

### Technology & Use Case
stETH functions as a tokenized representation of staked ETH, combining the value of the initial deposit with accumulated staking rewards. The core technology involves the minting of stETH tokens upon deposit of ETH into Lido and their burning upon redemption. The token balance is pegged 1:1 to the underlying staked ETH and is updated daily to reflect earned rewards. This mechanism allows stETH to be used like regular Ether, providing the dual benefit of earning ETH staking rewards and participating in DeFi activities to potentially earn additional yields. The use case is compelling as it addresses a significant pain point for ETH stakers by providing liquidity, which is essential for broader adoption of ETH staking and integration within the DeFi ecosystem.

### Tokenomics
The tokenomics of stETH are dynamic and directly tied to the staking activity within the Lido protocol. The supply of stETH is not fixed; tokens are minted when users deposit ETH for staking and burned when users redeem their staked ETH. The token balances are also updated daily to reflect staking earnings and rewards, indicating an inflationary mechanism driven by staking rewards. As of the provided data, the total supply and circulating supply are identical at 9,101,888.41268033 stETH, and there is no specified maximum supply, which aligns with its nature as a liquid staking derivative. Information regarding the distribution of stETH to the team, investors, or community is not available in the provided data.

### Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the specific team members behind Lido Staked Ether, their backgrounds, or a detailed roadmap for the project's future development is not provided in the available fundamental data. The developer data indicates no recent forks, stars, subscribers, issues, pull requests, code additions/deletions, or commit activity within the last four weeks from the provided source, which suggests that this specific dataset does not capture granular developer activity for stETH itself, but rather focuses on its economic and descriptive aspects.

### Proof
- Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a token that represents your staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit and staking rewards.
- stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed.
- stETH token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido and the tokens balances are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards.
- stETH tokens can be used as one would use ether, allowing you to earn ETH 2. 0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e. yields across decentralised finance products

## Wrapped steth
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Wrapped stETH (wstETH)

### Project Summary
Wrapped stETH (wstETH) is a derivative token designed to represent a pro-rata ownership of staked Ethereum (stETH) and its accumulated earnings. It addresses the rebase mechanism of stETH, where account balances change daily, by offering a non-rebasing alternative. This makes wstETH more compatible with various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, as its balance remains constant while its underlying value accrues. The project is an extension of the Lido liquid staking protocol, which aims to simplify Ethereum staking by removing the need for users to run their own infrastructure, while providing liquidity for staked assets.

### Technology & Use Case
wstETH functions as a wrapped version of stETH, conceptually similar to a c-token. Its core technology involves a wrapping mechanism where stETH is deposited to mint wstETH, and wstETH can be unwrapped to redeem stETH plus any accumulated earnings. This minting and burning process directly ties wstETH's supply to the amount of stETH being wrapped and unwrapped. The primary utility of wstETH is to provide a liquid, yield-bearing asset that can be seamlessly integrated into various DeFi applications without the complexities associated with rebasing tokens. This use case is compelling as it unlocks the liquidity of staked ETH, allowing users to participate in DeFi activities while still earning staking rewards, thereby enhancing capital efficiency within the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Tokenomics
wstETH's economic model is directly tied to stETH, which in turn represents staked ETH. The provided data indicates a market capitalization of $14,425,773,122 and a fully diluted valuation of $14,425,773,122. The total supply and circulating supply are both reported as 3,239,669.995910264, suggesting that all existing tokens are currently in circulation. There is no specified maximum supply, which is consistent with a wrapped token whose supply dynamically adjusts based on the amount of stETH wrapped and unwrapped. As a wrapped token, wstETH itself does not have traditional inflationary or deflationary mechanisms; instead, its value accrues from the underlying stETH's staking rewards, meaning that unwrapping wstETH yields more stETH than initially wrapped, reflecting the earnings.

### Team & Roadmap
Based on the provided fundamental data, there is no information available regarding the project team's background or a detailed future roadmap. The developer data, including forks, stars, subscribers, total issues, closed issues, pull requests merged, pull request contributors, code additions/deletions, and commit count over the last four weeks, are all reported as zero or null. This suggests a lack of publicly available developer activity metrics or a non-transparent approach to reporting such data.

### Proof
- wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. Instead of rebasing, or changing account holdings daily it is similar to a c-token. It represents a pro-rata ownership of the staked ETH (stETH).
- When someone exits wstETH they are returned principal stETH + stETH earnings.
- Lido is a liquid staking protocol for POS blockchains. It gives you a liquid token that represents your staked collateral and earnings over time. Lido removes the need to run infrastructure and enabling continued participation in DeFi.
- wstETH is minted and burned as stETH is wrapped and unwrapped

This bearish crossover continued, and by 2025-07-30, the price (383.3267) was below both the EMA (411.6695) and SMA (411.3504). This downward trend persisted, and by the end of the data series on 2025-08-04, the price (355.528) remained well below both the EMA (374.8180) and SMA (402.2066). Furthermore, the 13-period EMA has now crossed below the 21-period SMA, confirming a bearish crossover of the moving averages themselves, indicating a shift from an uptrend to a downtrend in the short to medium term.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI was in a neutral range, often approaching the overbought threshold (70) during price rallies in mid-July. Specifically, on 2025-07-16, RSI reached 69.3491. However, from 2025-07-24 (RSI 59.3505) onwards, the RSI has shown a clear declining trend, moving deeper into the neutral territory. While it has not yet entered the oversold region (<30), the consistent decline to values like 34.1198 on 2025-08-03 indicates weakening momentum. The very last two data points on 2025-08-04 show a slight rebound in RSI to 39.8926 and 41.7694, but it remains in the lower end of the neutral range.

### Volume Analysis
Initial price rallies in mid-July, such as the increase from 2025-07-15 (volume 222.96M) to 2025-07-16 (volume 231.09M) and the jump on 2025-07-22 (volume 195.31M) and 2025-07-23 (volume 291.64M), were supported by robust trading volumes, confirming buying interest. However, the subsequent significant price declines were accompanied by notable volume spikes, indicating strong selling pressure. For instance, the sharp drop on 2025-07-29 saw volume increase to 165.09M from 82.28M the previous day. The sustained decline in early August (e.g., 2025-08-02 volume 185.63M) suggests continued bearish conviction. The most recent slight price rebound on 2025-08-04, with volumes of 94.11M and 81.81M, occurred on comparatively lower volume than the preceding selling days, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support the bounce.

### Outlook
The technical analysis for Bittensor indicates a shift towards a bearish outlook. The price has decisively broken below its key moving averages, signaling a downtrend. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has weakened considerably, although it has not yet reached oversold conditions. Crucially, recent price declines were accompanied by significant volume, confirming strong selling conviction, while attempts at a rebound have occurred on comparatively lower volume, suggesting a lack of strong buying interest. This combination of factors points to continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.

## Near protocol
### Trend Analysis
The data for NEAR Protocol shows a fluctuating trend. From late September to early December 2024, the price was generally in an uptrend, with the price mostly trading above both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA. A significant "golden cross" (EMA crossing above SMA) occurred around 2024-09-25, reinforcing this bullish sentiment. However, a sharp reversal began in mid-December 2024, with the price falling significantly below both moving averages. A "death cross" (EMA crossing below SMA) was observed around 2024-12-10, signaling a downtrend that persisted into early May 2025. Another "golden cross" occurred around 2025-05-09, as the price surged above both moving averages. This was followed by a period where the price fluctuated around the moving averages, with another "death cross" around 2025-06-05. Most recently, around 2025-07-03, a "golden cross" occurred, with the price moving above the EMA and SMA. However, in the very last few data points (from 2025-07-24 onwards), the price has fallen below both the EMA and SMA, and the EMA has now crossed below the SMA (around 2025-08-02/03), indicating a renewed short-term downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for NEAR Protocol has shown periods of both overbought and oversold conditions. In late 2024, the RSI frequently entered overbought territory (above 70), notably peaking at 76.28 on 2024-12-07, indicating strong bullish momentum. Following this, the RSI entered oversold territory (below 30) in early February 2025, reaching a low of 25.04 on 2025-02-07, suggesting the asset was undervalued or experiencing strong selling pressure. Another period of overbought conditions was observed in mid-May 2025, with the RSI reaching 74.98 on 2025-05-11. More recently, in late July 2025, the RSI again entered overbought territory, peaking at 75.44 on 2025-07-22 and 2025-07-23. Since then, the RSI has been declining sharply, moving from overbought levels to its current neutral reading of 44.29 on 2025-08-04, indicating a significant loss of bullish momentum.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for NEAR Protocol has shown significant activity, often confirming price movements. Periods of strong uptrends in late 2024 and mid-2025 were accompanied by notable volume spikes (e.g., 2024-09-24, 2024-11-12, 2024-11-25, 2024-12-03 to 2024-12-07, 2025-05-09 to 2025-05-11, 2025-07-17 to 2025-07-23), suggesting strong buyer conviction. Conversely, sharp price declines, particularly in mid-December 2024 (2024-12-10, 2024-12-11, 2024-12-20, 2024-12-21) and early February 2025 (2025-02-04), were also met with exceptionally high selling volumes, confirming significant bearish pressure. The recent price decline from late July 2025 (e.g., 2025-07-24, 2025-08-02) has been accompanied by elevated volumes compared to earlier periods in July, particularly on 2025-08-02 with a volume of 352.45M, which confirms the recent downward price action and suggests continued selling interest. The latest volume on 2025-08-04 (114.89M) is lower than the peak selling volumes but still supports the recent price dip.

### Outlook
NEAR Protocol has recently shifted from a short-term uptrend to a downtrend. The price has fallen below both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and a "death cross" of the EMA below the SMA has just occurred around 2025-08-02/03, signaling bearish momentum. This decline in price is confirmed by elevated trading volumes, particularly on 2025-08-02. Concurrently, the 14-period RSI has seen a significant drop from overbought levels (75.44 on 2025-07-23) to a neutral reading of 44.29, indicating a substantial loss of bullish momentum and a shift towards bearish sentiment. The combined signals from trend, momentum, and volume suggest a prevailing bearish technical outlook for NEAR Protocol in the immediate term.

## Internet computer
### Trend Analysis
The price of Internet Computer is currently below both its 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 5.3289 and its 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of 5.5653. This indicates a short-term bearish trend. A significant death cross, where the 13-period EMA crossed below the 21-period SMA, occurred around July 31, 2025, further confirming the shift to a bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The latest 14-period RSI value is 43.49, which is in the neutral range (between 30 and 70). The RSI has been generally declining from late July, moving from a higher neutral range towards the lower neutral range, indicating decreasing bullish momentum. There was a slight uptick on the last recorded day.

### Volume Analysis
Recent volume analysis shows mixed signals. While some price declines in late July were accompanied by increased volume (e.g., July 29 and August 2), confirming selling pressure, the most recent attempts at price recovery on August 4 were on significantly lower volume (34,496,180.79). This suggests a lack of strong buying conviction to support a sustained upward price movement.

### Outlook
The technical analysis for Internet Computer indicates a prevailing bearish outlook in the short term. The price is trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and a death cross occurred around July 31, 2025, signaling a shift to a downtrend. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is neutral but has been weakening. Volume analysis shows some confirmation of selling pressure during price declines, but recent minor price increases have been on significantly lower volume, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to reverse the current trend.

## Artificial superintelligence alliance
### Trend Analysis
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance token exhibited a clear uptrend from late August to early December 2024, as evidenced by the price consistently trading above its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA. A golden cross, where the EMA crossed above the SMA, was observed around August 25, 2024, confirming the bullish trend. This uptrend reversed around mid-December 2024, with the price falling below both moving averages. A death cross, where the EMA crossed below the SMA, occurred around December 18, 2024, signaling a shift to a downtrend that persisted through early 2025. A brief period of recovery and consolidation was noted in late April 2025, with a golden cross occurring around April 18, 2025, and the price moving above its moving averages. However, this recovery was short-lived, as another death cross was observed around June 1, 2025. Since then, the token has been in a renewed downtrend, with the price consistently trading below both the EMA and SMA, and the EMA remaining below the SMA, indicating a prevailing bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI showed periods of strong momentum, entering overbought territory (>70) in late August, late September, early December 2024, and again in late April and early May 2025, coinciding with price surges. Conversely, the RSI dipped into oversold territory (<30) in early February and briefly in mid-March 2025 during significant price declines. In the most recent period, the RSI has been trending downwards from mid-May 2025, moving from the upper neutral range towards the lower neutral range, and briefly approaching oversold levels in late June and early August 2025. The last recorded RSI value of 40.05 indicates neutral momentum with a recent bearish bias.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume showed significant activity throughout the analyzed period. Notable volume spikes accompanied strong price increases in late August, late November, and early December 2024, confirming bullish conviction during those uptrends. Conversely, substantial volume also accompanied major price declines in late August, early October, mid-November, and mid-December 2024, indicating strong selling pressure. In the most recent period, particularly from June to August 2025, several significant volume spikes have coincided with price drops (e.g., July 12, July 15, July 23, July 24, July 29, and August 2), suggesting that selling pressure has been confirmed by increased participation during the current downtrend. While there were some volume increases on up days, the overall pattern in the latter part of the data indicates that higher volume is more frequently associated with bearish price action.

### Outlook
The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance token experienced a significant uptrend in late 2024, marked by price consistently above moving averages, a golden cross, and strong momentum confirmed by high volume. However, this was followed by a prolonged downtrend in early 2025, characterized by price falling below moving averages, a death cross, and the RSI entering oversold conditions, often accompanied by high selling volume. A brief recovery occurred in late April and early May 2025, with a golden cross and RSI entering overbought territory, but this proved to be short-lived. The token has since re-entered a downtrend, with the price consistently trading below both the EMA and SMA, and the EMA remaining below the SMA (a death cross occurred around June 1, 2025). The RSI has been declining, indicating weakening momentum, and recent price drops have been confirmed by notable volume. The current technical outlook suggests a bearish trend, with the price struggling to find support above its key moving averages and momentum indicators pointing downwards.

## Virtuals protocol
### Trend Analysis
Virtuals Protocol is exhibiting a clear downtrend. The price has consistently remained below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the recent data. Furthermore, the 13-period EMA is trading below the 21-period SMA, which is a bearish signal confirming the downtrend. A 'death cross' (EMA crossing below SMA) occurred in the earlier part of the provided data around late May/early June 2025, solidifying the bearish trend that has persisted.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has been trending downwards, briefly entering the oversold territory (<30) on 2025-08-03 with a value of 28.49. Subsequently, it has bounced back slightly into the neutral range, currently at 33.17. This indicates that the asset experienced significant selling pressure, but the recent bounce suggests a potential easing of this pressure, though momentum remains weak.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis shows mixed signals. While some recent price declines (e.g., 2025-07-29 and 2025-07-30) were accompanied by increased trading volume, confirming the conviction behind the downtrend, other instances of price drops (e.g., 2025-08-01 and 2025-08-03) saw a decrease in volume. The most recent price dip on 2025-08-04 was on significantly lower volume (79.4M), which could suggest a lack of strong selling conviction at this specific price level.

### Outlook
Virtuals Protocol is currently in a clear downtrend, as evidenced by the price trading consistently below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA. The EMA is also positioned below the SMA, reinforcing the bearish trend. Momentum indicators show the RSI briefly dipping into oversold territory before a slight recovery, suggesting that while selling pressure has been intense, it might be approaching a point of exhaustion. Volume analysis presents a mixed picture; while some price declines were confirmed by increased volume, others saw decreasing volume, which could indicate a lack of strong conviction from sellers at lower price points. The overall technical outlook remains bearish, with potential for consolidation or a short-term bounce if selling pressure continues to wane.

## Filecoin
### Trend Analysis
The price of Filecoin has been in a clear downtrend in the latter half of the provided data. After a period of upward movement and consolidation, the price broke below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA around late October/early November 2024. A death cross, where the EMA crossed below the SMA, occurred around November 14, 2024. Since then, the price has consistently traded below both moving averages, with the EMA remaining below the SMA, indicating a sustained bearish trend. The most recent data points show the price at 2.3837, well below the EMA of 2.4774 and the SMA of 2.6169, confirming the ongoing downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Filecoin has shown significant fluctuations throughout the data. After reaching overbought levels (above 70) in early December 2024 and again briefly in mid-May 2025 (70.72 on 2025-05-11), it has since declined. In late January/early February 2025, the RSI dipped into oversold territory (below 30), indicating strong selling pressure. More recently, from late May onwards, the RSI has mostly remained in the lower half of the neutral range (30-70), frequently approaching or dipping below 40. The latest RSI reading of 42.41 on 2025-08-04 indicates that momentum is currently neutral but leaning bearish, having recently moved up from lower levels.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Filecoin has been highly dynamic. Periods of significant price increases in late 2024 were confirmed by exceptionally high trading volumes, with multiple days exceeding 1 billion. Conversely, the sharp price declines in late 2024 and early 2025 were also accompanied by substantial volume, indicating strong selling conviction. More recently, during the sustained downtrend from mid-May 2025, volume has generally been lower than the peaks but still shows notable spikes on days with significant price drops (e.g., 2025-05-31, 2025-06-06, 2025-06-14, 2025-06-23, 2025-07-24, 2025-08-02). This suggests that selling pressure remains active and is confirmed by volume, even as overall trading activity has somewhat normalized from its previous highs. The most recent daily volume (99.20M) is moderate and accompanies a slight price increase after a period of decline.

### Outlook
Filecoin is currently in a clear downtrend, as evidenced by the price consistently trading below both its EMA and SMA, with the EMA remaining below the SMA. This bearish trend is further supported by the RSI, which, despite a recent slight uptick, remains in the lower neutral range, indicating weak buying momentum. Volume analysis shows that significant price movements, both up and down, have historically been confirmed by high trading activity. While recent volumes are not as extreme as previous peaks, notable spikes on down days confirm continued selling pressure. The overall technical outlook for Filecoin, based on the provided data, is bearish, with price action and moving averages indicating a sustained downward trajectory, and momentum indicators not yet showing strong signs of a reversal.

## Chutes
### Trend Analysis
In the initial period where both moving averages are available (from 2025-06-26), the price of Chutes was consistently below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with the EMA also below the SMA (e.g., on 2025-06-26, price was 58.88, EMA 70.19, SMA 77.98), indicating a clear downtrend. A significant bullish shift occurred around mid-July; on 2025-07-16, the price (73.57) surged above both the EMA (57.35) and SMA (54.43). Concurrently, the EMA crossed above the SMA on the same day, forming a golden cross, signaling a potential uptrend. However, this uptrend was brief. By 2025-07-29, the EMA (61.54) crossed back below the SMA (61.97), forming a death cross, indicating a resumption of the downtrend. Towards the end of the data, the price (e.g., 45.71 on 2025-08-04) remains significantly below both the EMA (50.89) and SMA (59.35), with the EMA also well below the SMA, confirming a strong and persistent bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Chutes began in oversold territory (below 30) in late June (e.g., 28.72 on 2025-06-22). It then fluctuated in the lower neutral range, frequently approaching oversold conditions again in early July (e.g., 28.69 on 2025-07-08). A significant surge in momentum was observed from July 10th to July 18th, with the RSI rising sharply to the mid-60s (e.g., 65.72 on 2025-07-16, 65.96 on 2025-07-18), indicating strong bullish momentum, though it did not enter overbought territory (>70). Following this peak, the RSI has steadily declined, re-entering oversold territory from July 31st to August 3rd (e.g., 29.81 on 2025-08-01, 27.47 on 2025-08-03). The last two data points on August 4th show a slight rebound in RSI (32.35 and 34.09), moving just above the oversold threshold but still indicating weak momentum.

### Volume Analysis
The initial price decline from mid-June to early July saw mixed volume, with some higher volumes on down days (e.g., 7.09M on 2025-06-18 during a minor price drop), suggesting selling interest. The notable price surge from 2025-07-09 to 2025-07-16 was strongly confirmed by a significant increase in trading volume, culminating in a peak volume of 7.13M on 2025-07-16, which coincided with the price reaching its highest point in this period. This indicates strong buying conviction during the brief upward move. Following this peak, as the price began its subsequent decline from 2025-07-19, volume generally decreased initially, suggesting a lack of strong selling conviction. However, towards the end of the data, the continued price depreciation from 2025-07-28 to 2025-08-04 is accompanied by several notable volume spikes (e.g., 2.80M on 2025-07-28, 4.58M on 2025-07-31, 5.82M on 2025-08-02, and 4.81M/4.47M on 2025-08-04), indicating renewed and strong selling pressure that confirms the recent downtrend.

### Outlook
Chutes has experienced a significant bearish trend throughout much of the provided data. While there was a brief bullish reversal in mid-July, marked by a golden cross and strong volume, this proved to be short-lived. The subsequent death cross in late July, combined with the price consistently trading below both the EMA and SMA, firmly re-established a strong downtrend. The RSI has recently re-entered oversold territory, indicating persistent bearish momentum. Furthermore, recent price declines have been accompanied by notable spikes in selling volume, confirming the conviction behind the downward movement. The overall technical outlook for Chutes is currently strongly bearish, with no clear signs of an immediate reversal based on the provided data.

## Iotex
### Trend Analysis
IoTeX is exhibiting a clear uptrend. The price is consistently trading above both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Specifically, the latest price of 0.0289 is above the EMA of 0.02648 and the SMA of 0.02506. Furthermore, the EMA has been above the SMA since approximately June 4, 2025, and has continued to widen its lead, confirming a sustained bullish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for IoTeX has recently moved into overbought territory, with the latest reading at 70.77. This indicates strong buying pressure in the very short term. The RSI significantly surged from neutral levels (around 47-48) on July 29-30, 2025, to enter the overbought zone by August 1, 2025, and has largely remained there.

### Volume Analysis
The recent sharp increase in price from July 30, 2025 (0.0227) to July 31, 2025 (0.0267) was accompanied by a massive volume spike from 8.27 million to 83.18 million, strongly confirming the upward price movement. While the price continued to rise in the following days (to 0.0289 by August 4, 2025), the trading volume has progressively decreased from its peak (49.60 million, 54.36 million, 23.75 million, and 14.52 million), suggesting that the conviction behind the most recent price advances may be waning compared to the initial surge.

### Outlook
IoTeX is currently in a clear uptrend, as evidenced by the price trading above both its EMA and SMA, and the EMA maintaining a position above the SMA. The recent price surge was initially confirmed by a significant spike in trading volume, indicating strong conviction behind the move. However, the subsequent days have seen decreasing volume despite continued price appreciation, which could suggest a slight weakening of buying conviction on the latest price increases. The momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is currently in overbought territory, suggesting that the asset may be due for a consolidation or pullback in the near term.

## Targon
### Trend Analysis
Targon's price has been in a notable downtrend in the latter half of the provided data. From 2025-07-30 onwards, the price consistently traded below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). A significant bearish crossover occurred around 2025-08-01/2025-08-02, where the 13-period EMA (25.2994 on 2025-08-01) fell below the 21-period SMA (26.2534 on 2025-08-01), and this relationship has persisted to the last data point (EMA 23.0895 vs SMA 25.4928 on 2025-08-04), reinforcing the bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Targon was in a neutral range (above 50) until 2025-07-29. On 2025-07-30, the RSI sharply declined from 53.10 to 41.25, indicating a significant loss of bullish momentum. It continued to fall, entering the oversold territory (<30) on 2025-08-03 with a value of 29.32. While the RSI has since slightly recovered to 34.63 on the last data point (2025-08-04), it remains in the lower end of the neutral range, suggesting continued weak momentum and a lack of strong buying pressure.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis reveals a significant spike on 2025-07-29 (5.66 million) which coincided with a slight price increase, followed by a sharp price decline on 2025-07-30 accompanied by high volume (1.14 million), indicating strong selling pressure. Subsequently, as the price continued its downward trajectory or consolidated at lower levels, the trading volume generally decreased, with the last few days showing relatively low volumes (e.g., 187K and 249K on 2025-08-04). This suggests that the recent downtrend is not being met with strong buying interest, and the lack of increasing volume on the slight price rebound on 2025-08-04 indicates a lack of conviction for a reversal.

### Outlook
Targon is currently exhibiting a clear bearish technical outlook. The price has firmly established a downtrend, consistently trading below its key moving averages, which themselves have formed a bearish crossover. Momentum is weak, having recently dipped into oversold conditions, and the subsequent slight recovery lacks conviction. While the initial sharp decline was on high volume, indicating strong selling, the subsequent lower volumes during price consolidation/further decline suggest a lack of significant buying interest to reverse the trend. The combined signals point towards continued bearish pressure.

## Chainlink
### Trend Analysis
Chainlink's price action shows a shift to a bearish trend. A significant death cross occurred on 2025-08-02, where the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossed below the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). Since this crossover, the price has consistently traded below both the EMA and SMA, with the EMA (17.085) now below the SMA (17.754) as of the last data point on 2025-08-04, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Chainlink has been trending downwards from near overbought levels (approaching 70) in late July, moving into the neutral range. The most recent RSI values are 46.29 and 49.51 on 2025-08-04, indicating that momentum has shifted from bullish to a more neutral stance. While there was a slight uptick in the last two data points, the overall trend in momentum has been bearish since late July.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for Chainlink saw a significant spike on 2025-08-02, reaching over 1 billion, which coincided with a notable price drop from 16.9475 to 16.1001. This high volume on a down move confirms strong selling pressure and conviction behind the recent price decline. Subsequent days (2025-08-03 and 2025-08-04) have seen substantially lower volumes, even with slight price increases, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support any upward movement following the large sell-off.

### Outlook
Chainlink is currently in a bearish trend, as indicated by the recent death cross and price trading below key moving averages. Momentum has shifted to neutral after a period of decline from overbought conditions. The recent significant price drop was confirmed by high selling volume, while subsequent minor price increases have lacked strong buying conviction. The technical outlook suggests continued caution, with a need for sustained buying volume to reverse the established bearish trend.
