    # NARRATIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
    Emerging Narrative: Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI) & Crypto Convergence

The most significant emerging market narrative is the convergence of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeAI) and cryptocurrency. This narrative centers on building AI models, agents, and infrastructure directly on blockchain networks, leveraging decentralized principles to create an "economy of autonomous intelligence" and drive towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through open, merit-based collaboration [915, 925, 928, 949].

Key projects and players are actively shaping this space. Bittensor, with its TAO token, is frequently highlighted as a leader in decentralized AI, fostering global collaboration and innovation through its deflationary token economy and halving cycles [915, 928, 936, 937, 938]. TheoriqAI, powered by its THQ token, is positioned as a foundational element for "agentic finance and on-chain intelligence," with THQ enabling access to premium agents, staking, governance, and protocol upgrades [841, 918, 994, 995]. Infinit, utilizing its IN token, is leveraging AI agents for automated and optimized DeFi strategies, offering one-click optimization, compounding, and user rewards [837, 858, 997, 1014, 990]. Other notable projects include Uomi with its on-chain AI chat agent [837], Trady rolling out enhanced AI agent tools [997], GAIA powering an incentivized AI agent network [1003], ARBUS with its flywheel design for AI interactions [1007], LMRA for governance and agent training [1017], and MAMO, an AI robo-advisor token, added to Coinbase's roadmap [1022].

The primary drivers behind this emerging narrative are multifaceted:

1.  **Technological Innovation**: There is a strong focus on developing decentralized AI networks and AI agents capable of governing DAOs, managing finance, and executing complex DeFi strategies autonomously [841, 913, 1014]. This is supported by advancements in underlying blockchain infrastructure, including zero-knowledge proofs and modular Layer 1s specifically designed for AI applications [735, 755].

2.  **Token Economics**: Native tokens, such as TAO, THQ, and IN, are integral to this ecosystem. They are designed to incentivize contributions, validate AI advancements, and create deflationary models that reward quality and participation, leading to potential supply shocks and price appreciation [915, 928, 936, 937, 938, 994, 995, 997, 1007].

3.  **Bridging AI with Web3 and DeFi**: The integration of AI into decentralized finance aims to make DeFi

## Internet computer
### Fundamental Analysis


# Internet Computer (ICP) Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
The Internet Computer (IC) is described as the world's first blockchain capable of running at web speed with unrestricted capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, its primary goal is to extend the public internet into a decentralized global computing platform, thereby enabling smart contract development at scale and revolutionizing web services. It aims to overcome limitations of traditional blockchains like high costs, slow speeds, and inability to serve frontends, allowing for fully decentralized applications (dapps) to be hosted end-to-end on the blockchain without reliance on traditional cloud services.

## Technology & Use Case
The IC operates as a network of interacting replicated state machines, hosting and executing "canisters," which are its form of smart contracts. These canisters are general-purpose, tamperproof, autonomous, and composable programs that can store data, perform computations, and provide a complete technology stack, including serving web pages directly to end users. The IC employs a "reverse-gas model" where canister developers pre-pay computational and storage costs using "cycles," which are obtained by converting ICP tokens. Cycles are burned after use, acting as a transaction fee. The network is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called the Network Nervous System (NNS), which is based on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model. The ICP token plays three prominent roles: network governance (users are rewarded for participation), production of Cycles for Compute (ICP is converted and burned as transaction fees), and rewarding users for securing the network. This design aims to provide a more cost-effective, higher throughput, lower latency, and more scalable platform compared to existing smart contract platforms. The ability for smart contracts to directly serve HTTP requests makes the use case compelling as it allows for truly end-to-end decentralized applications, eliminating reliance on centralized cloud providers.

## Tokenomics
The native token of the Internet Computer is ICP. As of the provided data, the `total_supply` and `circulating_supply` are both 536,260,668.3036067. There is no specified `max_supply`, suggesting it might be infinite or dynamically adjusted. The primary deflationary mechanism mentioned is the conversion of ICP into cycles, which are then burned as transaction fees. For governance, ICP tokens are staked in the NNS, with voting power determined by the amount staked. The project raised a total of $121 million from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital.

## Team & Roadmap
The Internet Computer project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams. The DFINITY Foundation is responsible for its development. A significant milestone was achieved on May 10, 2021, when DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, releasing its source code and the ICP utility token for network governance. The project has attracted significant investment from notable venture capital firms. Developer activity shows a healthy number of recent commits (567 in the last 4 weeks) and code additions (55,572 additions vs. 36,372 deletions), indicating ongoing development. The whitepaper, updated on December 18, 2023, is version 1.4, suggesting continuous iteration and development of the protocol.

### Proof
- Internet Computer (IC) is the worlds first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services.
- Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the worlds computing platform, in a decentralized manner.
- The project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic WIlliams and have raised a total of $121 million from investors such as Adreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital and such.
- On May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, marking it a major milestone for ICP as it means the internet now functions as a decentralised global computer.
- ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles: 1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI 2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network
- The IC consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that connects independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute "canisters", the IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters can store data, perform very general computations on that data, and provide a complete technology stack, serving web pages directly to end users.
- Computational and storage costs are covered by a "reverse-gas model", where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC. ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol.
- Compared to existing smart contract platforms, the IC is designed to: bemore cost e ective , in particular, allowing applications to compute and store data at a fraction of the cost of previous platforms; provide higher throughput and lower latency for processing smart contract transac- tions; bemore scalable , in particular, the IC can process unbounded volumes of smart con- tract data and computation natively because it can grow in capacity by adding more nodes to the network.
- In addition to providing a smart contract platform, the IC is designed to act as a complete technology stack , such that systems and services can be built that run entirely on the IC. In particular, smart contracts on the IC can service HTTP requests created by end users, so that smart contracts can directly serve interactive web experiences.
- The IC's DAO is called the network nervous system (NNS) , and is based on a PoS, so that all decisions taken by the NNS are made by community members whose voting power is determined by how much of the IC's native governance 5 token they have staked in the NNS

## Artificial superintelligence alliance
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis: Artificial Superintelligence Alliance

### Project Summary
The Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance is a pioneering open-source initiative dedicated to advancing decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Formed in April 2024 through a community-approved tokenomic merger of SingularityNET ($AGIX), Fetch.ai ($FET), and Ocean Protocol ($OCEAN) into a single unified $FET token, the Alliance aims to address the limitations of centralized AI systems. Its core mission is to democratize access to advanced intelligence, ensuring it remains a shared and accessible resource, while providing a robust, open-source innovation stack for ethical, scalable, and groundbreaking AI solutions. The recent integration of CUDOS further enhances the Alliance's capacity by providing scalable, decentralized computing power, which is crucial for moving beyond narrow AI towards human-cognition-matching models.

### Technology & Use Case
The ASI Alliance leverages a sophisticated technological stack focused on decentralized AI development. A key component is the integration of CUDOS's distributed cloud compute model, which provides scalable computing resources, reduces bottlenecks, enhances system robustness, and improves security by decentralizing data storage. This infrastructure underpins the three critical pillars of distributed systems: compute, storage, and communication, enabling the Alliance to build compound AI systems and solve complex problems. The project emphasizes the democratization of compute resources, offering cost-efficient access to on-demand cloud storage, compute, and communication for its community, aiming to prevent technological lock-in and foster innovation.

The ASI ($FET) token serves as the essential utility token driving this decentralized AI economy. Its utility is multi-layered:
*   **Layer 1 Utility:** It enables on-chain governance, allowing token holders to vote on critical decisions. It secures the network through a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model, where holders can stake ASI to become validators on the Fetch.ai (soon to be ASI) mainnet, earning rewards for contributing to network security and consensus.
*   **Inherited & Expanded Utilities:** The token integrates and amplifies functionalities from its founding protocols. It expands Ocean Protocol's data monetization framework through data farming (staking ASI for data pools), becomes the native token for accessing AI services on SingularityNET's marketplace, and powers agent registration and discovery mechanisms within the Fetch.ai network.
*   **CUDOS Integration Utility:** This merger introduces new utility by enabling ASI token holders to access and pay for computational resources at competitive rates, fostering a dynamic compute marketplace. Developers can also stake ASI to reduce their compute costs further. The token is positioned as the "linchpin" for funding and paying for AI-centric products and services on the blockchain.

The use case for the ASI token is compelling and essential for the ecosystem. It is designed to unify and empower a cohesive ecosystem built around an emerging AI economy, directly addressing the exponential demand for computational power in AI development and ensuring decentralized, open access to critical resources.

### Tokenomics
The ASI ($FET) token has a total supply and max supply of 2,714,493,896.672 tokens, with a circulating supply of 2,604,959,126.672 tokens. The token was formed through a community-approved tokenomic merger of $AGIX, $FET, and $OCEAN. While specific distribution percentages for team, investors, or community are not detailed in the provided information, the tokenomics incorporate mechanisms that influence its supply dynamics:
*   **Staking Rewards:** The Proof-of-Stake model for network security allows token holders to stake ASI and earn rewards, which implies a mechanism for new token issuance to incentivize participation, though the fixed max supply suggests a capped inflation or a distribution from a pre-allocated pool.
*   **Utility Staking:** Developers can stake ASI to reduce compute costs, which could lead to tokens being locked up, potentially reducing circulating supply for a period.

There are no explicit deflationary mechanisms like token burning mentioned in the provided data.

### Team & Roadmap
While specific individual team members and their backgrounds are not detailed, the project is a strategic alliance of well-established entities in the AI and blockchain space: SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS. This collaboration suggests a strong collective expertise and a proven track record from the constituent projects.

The roadmap is ambitious and clearly articulated, focusing on the long-term vision of decentralized AGI and ASI:
*   **Core Objective:** The Alliance is committed to "accelerating the advancement of decentralized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and, ultimately, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)."
*   **Mainnet Transition:** A key near-term objective is the transition of the Fetch.ai mainnet to the ASI mainnet, which will serve as the exclusive network for ASI staking and validation.
*   **Future Development:** The roadmap includes the "development of compound AI systems and, eventually, a framework for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence." The project anticipates that as the Alliance and its technology stack evolve, the ASI token will be central to emerging use cases, positioning its community and developers at the forefront of next-generation AI technologies. The integration of CUDOS is a significant step towards scaling compute resources for AGI/ASI development and achieving "sovereign compute," reducing reliance on centralized providers.

### Proof

### Fundamental Analysis


# Virtuals Protocol: Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Virtuals Protocol is an AI x Metaverse protocol focused on building the future of virtual interactions. It aims to address the lack of standardization, centralization, and limited interoperability in digital commerce, particularly for autonomous agents. The core solution is the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), a standardized, framework-agnostic protocol that leverages blockchain technology to secure and streamline information exchange for decentralized autonomous systems. ACP defines a four-phase interaction modelâ€”Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluationâ€”implemented via smart contracts to ensure transparent, verifiable, and tamper-resistant interactions between AI agents and humans.

## Technology & Use Case

**Core Technology:**
The Virtuals Protocol is built upon the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP), which is designed around four fundamental principles: Framework and Capability Agnosticism, Atomicity and Defined States, Deterministic Outcomes and Single Source of Truth, and Cryptographic Verifiability. ACP facilitates decentralized autonomous commerce through a four-phase smart contract-based interaction model:

1.  **Request Phase:** This initial phase establishes interaction, identifies participants via cryptographic signatures, and mandates a standardized request format. It includes an explicit accept/reject decision point and timeout mechanisms to manage transaction initiation.
2.  **Negotiation Phase:** In this critical stage, participants establish concrete terms of agreement, culminating in a cryptographically verifiable Proof of Agreement (PoA). Terms include agreed service, constraints, compensation, and evaluation requirements, with multi-signature schemes ensuring mutual consent.
3.  **Transaction Phase:** This phase handles the secure execution of agreed-upon terms, utilizing existing blockchain transactions. Payment and service delivery are withheld until the completion of the evaluation phase.
4.  **Evaluation Phase:** This final phase provides mechanisms for quality assessment and performance feedback, crucial for reputation building and system improvement. The protocol supports both human and agent evaluators, with evaluations based on agreed terms. It also enables a marketplace for specialized evaluator agents.

**Use Case:**
The primary use case for Virtuals Protocol is to enable safe, secure, and verifiable commerce among autonomous AI agents and humans in a decentralized manner. This addresses the compounding information loss and lack of standardization in multi-agent interactions. The protocol aims to facilitate complex autonomous businesses where specialized agents collaborate. A compelling aspect of the use case is the envisioned "Specialized Evaluator Agents Market," where domain-specific AI agents can provide high-quality evaluations, improving transaction integrity and fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem.

**Token Utility:**
The whitepaper indicates an economic model where "evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or set value part of the contract agreement) as compensation for their services." While the specific native token utility (e.g., for payments, staking, governance) is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, this fee structure suggests that the protocol facilitates value transfer, which could involve the native token, thereby incentivizing the development and operation of high-quality evaluation agents.

## Tokenomics

*   **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 VRT
*   **Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 VRT
*   **Circulating Supply:** 655,322,002.05 VRT
*   **Market Cap:** $794,727,003
*   **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** $1,212,727,484

The project has a fixed total and maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, with approximately 65.53% currently in circulation. The whitepaper details an economic model for evaluator agents, where they are compensated with a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3%). This mechanism creates incentives for participants within the ecosystem. However, the provided documentation does not specify the token distribution (e.g., allocations for team, investors, community, treasury) or explicit inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond the fee structure for evaluators.

### Proof
- An AI x Metaverse Protocol that is building the future of virtual interactions
- The landscape for commerce and regular everyday transactions lacks standardization, is centralized or makes assumptions about participant capabilities (either humans only or autonomous systems only), limiting interoperability and adoption.
- This paper presents the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP). ACP addresses these challenges by providing a framework and system agnostic protocol that defines the fundamental phases and requirements for safe, secure and verifiable autonomous agent commerce, by building on the strengths of the blockchain beyond just payments.
- ACP leverages blockchain technology to secure and streamline information exchange while introducing a four-phase interaction model - Request, Negotiation, Transaction, and Evaluation - implemented via smart contracts.
- ACP is constructed upon four fundamental principles that govern its design and implementation. These principles ensure the protocols flexibility, reliability, and broad applicability across different autonomous systems.
- 1 Request Phase The Request Phase establishes the initial interaction between participants. This phase defines the participants of the proposed transaction and determines preliminary compatibility.
- 2 Negotiation Phase The Negotiation Phase represents the critical stage where participating entities establish concrete terms of agreement through a deterministic process. This phase implements mechanisms to ensure that all terms are unambiguously specified and cryptographically verifiable. At the core of the Negotiation Phase lies the Proof of Agreement (PoA).
- 3 Transaction Phase The Transaction Phase handles the execution of agreed-upon terms through secure operations. This makes use of existing blockchain transactions, and uses the contract to check the execution of these transactions.
- 4 Evaluation Phase The Evaluation Phase provides mechanisms for quality assessment and performance feedback, enabling reputation building and system improvement.
- The protocol enables the emergence of a sophisticated marketplace for specialized evaluator agents.
- To ensure sustainable operation of high-quality evaluator agents, the protocol enables implementation of a fee structure where evaluators receive a percentage of the transaction value (typically 2-3% or set value part of the contract agreement) as compensation for their services.

## Lido staked ether
### Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a liquid staking token within the Ethereum ecosystem, primarily categorized under Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Liquid Staking Tokens. Its core purpose is to represent staked Ether (ETH) in the Lido protocol, integrating the value of the initial deposit with accrued staking rewards. This allows users to participate in ETH 2.0 staking while maintaining liquidity.

### Technology & Use Case
The underlying technology of stETH is characterized by a dynamic supply mechanism. stETH tokens are "minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed," directly correlating its supply to the amount of Ether staked and unstaked through Lido. The token balances are "pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido" and are "updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards." The primary use case for stETH is to enable users to "earn ETH 2.0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e. yields across decentralised finance products." This addresses the illiquidity issue inherent in traditional ETH staking, providing flexibility for users to utilize their staked assets within the broader DeFi ecosystem.

### Tokenomics
Lido Staked Ether operates with an elastic supply model, meaning there is no fixed maximum supply. The supply is directly influenced by user activity, as "stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed." This mechanism ensures that the supply adjusts dynamically based on the volume of ETH being staked and unstaked via Lido. As per the provided data, the circulating supply is 8,887,732.135531707 stETH, and the total supply is 8,887,822.295097943 stETH. The market capitalization and fully diluted valuation are both reported as $32,146,648,552, which is consistent with a token whose value is directly backed by the underlying staked assets.

### Team & Roadmap
Based on the provided fundamental data, specific information regarding the project's team background, their experience, or a detailed future roadmap is not available. The "developer_data" indicates no recent public code activity, with metrics such as forks, stars, issues, and commits all reported as zero. Furthermore, no link to a whitepaper was provided, limiting the ability to assess long-term strategic plans or detailed technical specifications from official documentation.

### Proof
- "Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a token that represents your staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit and staking rewards."
- "stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed."
- "stETH token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido and the tokens balances are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards."
- "stETH tokens can be used as one would use ether, allowing you to earn ETH 2. 0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e. yields across decentralised finance products"

## Wrapped steth
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis: Wrapped stETH (wstETH)

## Project Summary
wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH, which is the liquid staking token for staked Ethereum (ETH) provided by the Lido protocol. The primary problem wstETH aims to solve is to provide a non-rebasing representation of stETH. Unlike stETH, which changes account holdings daily to reflect staking rewards, wstETH operates similarly to a c-token, where its value accrues over time without altering the token balance in a user's wallet. This design makes wstETH more compatible with various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols that may not natively support rebasing tokens. It represents a pro-rata ownership of the underlying staked ETH and its earnings, allowing users to exit wstETH and receive their principal stETH plus accumulated earnings.

## Technology & Use Case
The core technology behind wstETH is its wrapping mechanism. wstETH is minted when stETH is wrapped and burned when stETH is unwrapped. This process allows stETH holders to convert their rebasing stETH into a static balance token that still represents their claim on staked ETH and its rewards. The primary utility of wstETH is to enable continued participation in DeFi for users who hold staked ETH via Lido, without the complexities associated with rebasing tokens. It allows users to leverage their staked ETH in various DeFi applications (e.g., lending, borrowing, liquidity provision) where a stable token balance is preferred or required. The use case is compelling as it enhances the composability of liquid staked ETH within the broader DeFi ecosystem, removing the need for users to run their own staking infrastructure while maintaining liquidity.

## Tokenomics
wstETH's economic model is directly tied to stETH. The supply of wstETH is dynamic, determined by the amount of stETH that is wrapped and unwrapped. The provided data indicates a total supply of 3,235,480.62195855 wstETH and a circulating supply of 3,238,636.512802212 wstETH. There is no defined maximum supply, and the concept of an infinite maximum supply is not explicitly stated but implied by its nature as a wrapped token whose supply adjusts based on user activity. Instead of inflationary rebasing, wstETH's value accrues internally, meaning that when someone unwraps wstETH, they receive a greater amount of stETH than they initially wrapped, reflecting the accumulated staking rewards. Information regarding the distribution of wstETH (e.g., team, investors, community allocations) is not available in the provided data.

## Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the specific team behind wstETH and its future roadmap is not available in the provided fundamental data. As wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH, its development and roadmap are inherently linked to the underlying Lido protocol and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The developer data provided shows no public activity (0 forks, 0 stars, 0 subscribers, 0 total issues, 0 closed issues, 0 pull requests merged, 0 pull request contributors, 0 commit count over 4 weeks), which is consistent with a wrapped token that primarily relies on the security and development of its underlying asset and protocol. There is also no link to a whitepaper provided.

### Proof
- wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH.
- Instead of rebasing, or changing account holdings daily it is similar to a c-token.
- It represents a pro-rata ownership of the staked ETH (stETH).
- When someone exits wstETH they are returned principal stETH + stETH earnings.
- Lido is a liquid staking protocol for POS blockchains.
- It gives you a liquid token that represents your staked collateral and earnings over time.
- Lido removes the need to run infrastructure and enabling continued participation in DeFi.
- wstETH is minted and burned as stETH is wrapped and unwrapped

## Internet computer
### Fundamental Analysis

## Internet Computer (ICP) Fundamental Analysis

### Project Summary
Internet Computer (IC) is a blockchain platform developed by the DFINITY Foundation, launched into the public domain on May 10, 2021. It aims to extend the public internet to become a decentralized global computing platform, thereby recreating the web and overhauling traditional software services. The project seeks to overcome the limitations of smart contracts on traditional blockchains, such as high transaction and storage costs, slow computational speed, and the inability to serve frontends directly to users. IC enables the deployment of fully decentralized applications (dApps) that are hosted end-to-end on the blockchain.

### Technology & Use Case
Internet Computer's core technology revolves around a network of cryptographic protocols connecting independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute "canisters," which are IC's form of smart contracts. Canisters are designed to be general-purpose, tamperproof, autonomous, composable, and support tokenization. The platform utilizes a "reverse-gas model," where canister developers pre-pay computational and storage costs using "cycles," which are obtained by converting ICP tokens. Cycles are burned upon use, acting as the transaction fee mechanism.

The IC is designed to offer significant improvements over existing smart contract platforms, including greater cost-effectiveness, higher throughput, lower latency, and enhanced scalability, capable of processing unbounded volumes of data and computation by adding more nodes. It functions as a complete technology stack, allowing systems and services to run entirely on the IC, directly serving interactive web experiences to end-users via HTTP requests without reliance on traditional cloud hosting services. This fosters interoperability, shared functions, permanent APIs, and ownerless applications, simplifying the technology stack for IT organizations and automatically persisting data in memory.

The Internet Computer is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called the Network Nervous System (NNS), which operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model. The NNS determines network topology, manages replicas, provides public-key infrastructure, and controls protocol upgrades. The ICP token is essential for the ecosystem, serving three primary roles:
1.  **Network Governance:** Users staking ICP tokens in the NNS gain voting power and are rewarded for participating in governance.
2.  **Production of Cycles for Compute:** ICP can be converted into cycles, which are consumed as transaction fees for accessing and utilizing the network's computational resources.
3.  **Rewarding Users:** ICP is used to incentivize users for their participation in securing and maintaining the network.

The use case for ICP is compelling and essential, as the token directly underpins the operational mechanics and governance of a platform aiming to decentralize the entire web stack, offering a robust alternative to centralized cloud infrastructure.

### Tokenomics
The Internet Computer's native token, ICP, has a total supply and circulating supply of 536,260,668.3036067 tokens, with a market capitalization and fully diluted valuation both at $2,778,693,851. The project does not specify a maximum supply, implying that the supply can increase over time. In terms of inflationary and deflationary mechanisms, ICP tokens are burned when converted into cycles for transaction fees, introducing a deflationary pressure. Conversely, ICP is used to reward users for network governance and participation, which can introduce new tokens into circulation, creating an inflationary pressure. The balance between these mechanisms will determine the long-term supply dynamics.

### Team & Roadmap
The Internet Computer project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams and is developed by the DFINITY Foundation. The project has successfully raised a total of $121 million from notable investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Multicoin Capital. A significant milestone was achieved on May 10, 2021, with the public launch of the Internet Computer, including the release of its source code and the ICP utility token for community governance.

The whitepaper, "The Internet Computer for Geeks (v1.4)," dated December 18, 2023, indicates ongoing development and documentation. The roadmap, as implied by the project's objectives and the NNS governance system, focuses on realizing the vision of Web3 by continuously evolving the network, creating new subnets, and implementing software updates. Developer activity metrics, such as 567 commits and 55,572 additions in the last four weeks, suggest active and continuous development efforts.

- Computational and storage costs are covered by a \reverse-gas model", where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC.
- ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol.
- Compared to existing smart contract platforms, the IC is designed to: bemore cost e ective , in particular, allowing applications to compute and store data at a fraction of the cost of previous platforms; provide higher throughput and lower latency for processing smart contract transac- tions; bemore scalable , in particular, the IC can process unbounded volumes of smart con- tract data and computation natively because it can grow in capacity by adding more nodes to the network.
- In addition to providing a smart contract platform, the IC is designed to act as a complete technology stack , such that systems and services can be built that run entirely on the IC. In particular, smart contracts on the IC can service HTTP requests created by end users, so that smart contracts can directly serve interactive web experiences.
- The IC's permission model is a hybrid model , obtaining the e ciency of a permissioned protocol while o ering many of the bene ts of a decentralized PoS protocol. This hybrid model is called a DAO-controlled network and (roughly speaking) works as follows: each subnet runs a permissioned consensus protocol, but a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) determines which entities provide replicas, con gures the topology of the network, provides a public-key infrastructure, and controls which version of the protocol is deployed to the replicas. The IC's DAO is called the network nervous system (NNS) , and is based on a PoS, so that all decisions taken by the NNS are made by community members whose voting power is determined by how much of the IC's native governance 5 token they have staked in the NNS (see Section 1. 8 for more on this token).
- ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles: 1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI 2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network
- Supports interoperability, shared functions, permanent APIs, and ownerless applica- tions, all of which reduce platform risk and encourages innovation and collaboration.
- Persists data automatically in memory, which eliminates the need for database servers and storage management, improves computational e ciency, and simpli es software development.

## Filecoin
### Fundamental Analysis

# Filecoin (FIL) Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that aims to create a global, open market for data storage. It addresses the issues of centralized storage by enabling anyone worldwide to participate as storage providers, thereby achieving significant economies of scale. The project seeks to transform data storage into a commodity or utility, where the price is determined by supply and demand rather than corporate pricing departments.

## Technology & Use Case
The core technology of Filecoin revolves around a decentralized network that allows individuals and entities to offer their storage space. This approach decouples hard-drive space from additional services, fostering a competitive environment where miners (storage providers) compete on factors such as reliability and price. The primary use case is to provide a robust, global market for data storage, making it more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective. The compelling nature of this use case lies in its potential to democratize data storage and introduce market-driven pricing, which is essential for a more resilient and censorship-resistant internet infrastructure.

## Tokenomics
Filecoin has a maximum supply of 1,959,167,382 FIL tokens, with a total supply currently at 1,959,167,368 FIL. The circulating supply is 683,725,608 FIL. As of the provided data, Filecoin has a market capitalization of $1,624,060,856 and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4,653,631,509. Information regarding the specific distribution of tokens (e.g., allocations for team, investors, community) and detailed inflationary or deflationary mechanisms was not provided in the available data.

## Team & Roadmap
Detailed information regarding the Filecoin team's background and a clear future roadmap was not available in the provided fundamental data. Furthermore, the developer activity metrics indicate a lack of recent public code contributions, with 0 forks, 0 stars, 0 subscribers, 0 total issues, 0 closed issues, 0 pull requests merged, 0 pull request contributors, and 0 commits in the last 4 weeks. This suggests a potential lack of transparency or public engagement in development activities based on the provided data.

### Proof
- The Filecoin network achieves staggering economies of scale by allowing anyone worldwide to participate as storage providers.
- It also makes storage resemble a commodity or utility by decoupling hard-drive space from additional services.
- On this robust global market the price of storage will be driven by supply and demand, not corporate pricing departments, and miners will compete on factors like reputation for reliability as well as price

## Bitcoin
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC)

## Project Summary
Bitcoin is presented as the first successful internet money, designed as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its core aim is to enable online payments directly between two parties without the need for a trusted financial institution, thereby circumventing the inherent weaknesses of trust-based models, such as mediation costs, transaction reversals, and fraud. The project was created by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, with its source code made publicly available as an open-source project.

## Technology & Use Case
Bitcoin's foundational technology is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that leverages a hash-based Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, similar to Adam Back's Hashcash, and the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This system timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of blocks, ensuring immutability as changing a record would require redoing all subsequent proof-of-work. The network's security relies on the collective CPU power of honest nodes, where the longest chain represents the majority's computational effort.

The primary use case for Bitcoin is as an electronic means of exchange, independent of central authorities. It facilitates mobile payments with very low transaction fees and aims to protect user identity by keeping public keys anonymous, recommending a new key pair for each transaction. The system addresses the double-spending problem through its distributed timestamp server and the longest chain rule. Transactions are structured with multiple inputs and outputs to allow for value splitting and combining, and Merkle Trees are used to efficiently manage disk space by allowing old, spent transactions to be discarded while maintaining block integrity. Furthermore, Bitcoin introduced 

### Proof
- Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency.
- It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.
- The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.
- The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way.
- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
- We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
- Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes.
- The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
- Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.
- It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.
- privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.
- A new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.
- To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.
- Transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
- It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.
- Being the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on.
- Bitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.
- max_supply: 21000000.0
- total_supply: 19902487.0
- circulating_supply: 19902487.0
- By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
- The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction.
- Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
- It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto.
- The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.
- To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Ethereum

### Project Summary
Ethereum is presented as a global, open-source platform designed for decentralized applications. Its core vision is to establish a "world computer" where anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner, ensuring that all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible.

### Technology & Use Case
Ethereum's core technology supports smart contracts, allowing developers to program digital value through code. This capability enables a wide array of decentralized applications (dapps), including tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, lending protocols, and decentralized exchanges. The native coin of the blockchain, Ether (ETH), plays a crucial role as the medium for paying transaction and smart contract execution fees, known as Gas. Gas is defined as the unit of measure for the computational effort required for operations, making ETH essential for the network's functionality and operations.

### Tokenomics
The tokenomics of Ethereum, based on the provided data, indicate a total supply and circulating supply of 120,709,390.4560704 ETH. Notably, there is no defined maximum supply, suggesting a potentially uncapped supply model. The economic model primarily highlights ETH's utility as the required payment for Gas fees, which fluctuate based on network demand. Information regarding the distribution of tokens among the team, investors, or community, as well as specific inflationary or deflationary mechanisms beyond gas fees, is not detailed in the provided data.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not contain explicit information about the Ethereum team's background or a detailed future roadmap. However, developer activity metrics are available, indicating ongoing development. These metrics include 19,618 forks, 44,422 stars, 2,195 subscribers, 7,683 total issues (with 7,427 closed), 5,779 pull requests merged, and 906 pull request contributors. Over the last four weeks, there were 23,340 code additions and 2,460 deletions, with a total of 41 commits, suggesting active and continuous development on the platform.

### Proof
- description: Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible.
- description: Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.
- description: On Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand

## Bnb
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of BNB

### Project Summary
BNB (Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance platform, which is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The project aims to facilitate trading activities on its platform by offering users the ability to pay various fees with BNB, thereby providing discounts and incentivizing its use.

### Technology & Use Case
Initially, BNB was an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Its primary utility is to serve as a payment method for fees on the Binance platform, including trading fees, transaction fees, and listing fees. Binance offers a tiered discount structure for users paying fees with BNB, starting with a 50% discount in the first year and gradually decreasing over five years, after which no discount is offered. This mechanism strongly incentivizes users to acquire and utilize BNB for their trading activities, making its use case compelling and essential for users seeking to reduce costs on the Binance exchange. In the future, BNB is also intended to be used as "gas" within the platform's ecosystem.

### Tokenomics
The initial total supply of BNB was capped at 200 million tokens. The distribution of BNB was as follows: 50% sold during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), 40% allocated to the team, and 10% to Angel investors. The current circulating supply and total supply are both reported as 139,288,192.53 BNB, with a maximum supply of 200,000,000.0 BNB. A significant deflationary mechanism implemented by Binance is a buyback and burn program. Binance announced a plan to buy back and burn up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018, which aims to reduce the total supply and increase the value of the remaining coins, benefiting investors.

### Team & Roadmap
The provided data indicates a distribution of tokens to a "team" (40% of the initial supply), but specific details regarding the team's background or key members are not available. Regarding the roadmap, the information states that "in the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas." While this indicates a continued utility and expansion of its role, a detailed future roadmap with specific milestones or development plans is not provided in the given data. The buyback plan mentioned was for Q1 2018, which is a past event.

### Proof
- Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the Binance platform.
- It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies.
- The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others.
- Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB.
- The schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12. 5% discount, fourth year 6. 75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount.
- This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.
- Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum
- In total, there will only be 200 million BNBs.
- Binance has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors.
- Binance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned.
- This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors.
- In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.

## Immutable
### Fundamental Analysis

# Fundamental Analysis of Immutable (IMX)

## Project Summary
Immutable is centered around the Immutable X network, which is identified as the first zk-rollup specifically designed for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The project aims to address scalability challenges for NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a Layer 2 solution that leverages Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology. Its primary focus areas include Gaming (GameFi), Play To Earn models, and the broader NFT marketplace, positioning itself as a key component within the Ethereum and Immutable zkEVM Ecosystems.

## Technology & Use Case
Immutable's core technology is the Immutable X network, which operates as a zk-rollup on Ethereum. This technology is designed to facilitate high-volume, gas-free NFT minting and trading, addressing the inherent limitations of the Ethereum mainnet regarding transaction speed and cost for digital assets. The native token, IMX, serves as the utility token for this network. While the specific utilities of the IMX token are not detailed in the provided data, its role as the "native token for the Immutable X network" implies its essentiality for network operations, potentially including transaction fees, staking, or governance within the Immutable X ecosystem. The project's strong categorization within 'Gaming (GameFi)', 'NFT', 'Play To Earn', and 'Gaming Blockchains' suggests a compelling use case for developers and players seeking scalable and efficient solutions for blockchain-based games and digital collectibles.

## Tokenomics
The IMX token has a clearly defined supply structure. The total supply is 2,000,000,000 IMX, which is also the maximum supply. This indicates a fixed cap on the total number of tokens that will ever exist, suggesting a non-inflationary model in terms of new token minting beyond this limit. The circulating supply is approximately 1,890,903,648.39 IMX, which represents a very high percentage of the total and maximum supply. This high circulation suggests that a significant portion of the tokens are already in the market. Information regarding the specific distribution breakdown (e.g., allocations for team, investors, community, ecosystem development) or detailed inflationary/deflationary mechanisms beyond the fixed max supply was not provided in the available data.

## Team & Roadmap
Information regarding the Immutable team's background and the project's future roadmap is not available in the provided fundamental data. The 'developer_data' field is listed as 'Not Listed', indicating a lack of specific details about the development team. Similarly, there is no information provided concerning the project's strategic roadmap, future developments, or milestones.

## Zcash
### Fundamental Analysis

## Fundamental Analysis of Zcash

### Project Summary
Zcash is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to provide privacy and selective transparency for transactions. It addresses the issue of public transaction visibility common in many blockchain networks by allowing users to keep the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction private, while still publishing the payment on a public blockchain.

### Technology & Use Case
Zcash's core technology leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically zero-knowledge proofs, known as zk-SNARKs. These proofs enable the network to verify the validity of encrypted transactions without revealing sensitive information such as the parties involved or the transaction amounts. This is a significant improvement over traditional public blockchains like Bitcoin, from which Zcash's codebase is derived. The primary use case for Zcash is to offer users the choice between private (shielded) and public (transparent) transactions. This flexibility allows users to control the visibility of their financial activities, making the use case compelling for those prioritizing privacy in their digital transactions.

### Tokenomics
Zcash operates with a finite maximum supply, capped at 21,000,000 ZEC, similar to Bitcoin's supply cap. As of the provided data, the total supply is approximately 16,207,509.54 ZEC, with a circulating supply very close to this at approximately 16,206,668.92 ZEC. The presence of a fixed maximum supply suggests a disinflationary model over time, as new tokens are minted until the cap is reached, after which no new tokens will be created, potentially leading to scarcity.

### Team & Roadmap
The Zcash project was built by a "security-specialized engineering team" and its core cryptographic innovation, zk-SNARKs, was "developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography." This indicates a strong technical foundation and expertise in the highly specialized field of cryptography and blockchain security. However, the provided data does not include specific details regarding a future roadmap or detailed team backgrounds beyond their technical specialization.

### Proof
- Zcash is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions.
- Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.
- Zcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over Bitcoin is the addition of privacy.
- Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.
- Zcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography.
- These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved.
- Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.
- Zcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value.

## Celestia
### Fundamental Analysis

# Celestia (TIA) Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Celestia is positioned as a foundational "data availability network" designed to simplify the creation of new blockchains. It operates as a "Layer 1 (L1)" and a "Modular Blockchain" within the "Cosmos Ecosystem," aiming to address the limitations of monolithic blockchain architectures by separating the data availability layer from the execution layer.

## Technology & Use Case
The core technological innovation of Celestia lies in its focus on "data availability." By providing a dedicated layer for ordering and publishing transaction data, Celestia enables developers to "easily create a new blockchain" without needing to build their own consensus and data availability mechanisms from scratch. This modular approach allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and specialization, as new blockchains can focus solely on their execution environment while relying on Celestia for data availability. The use case is compelling as it offers a solution to the blockchain scalability trilemma, allowing for the development of highly specialized and efficient application-specific blockchains or rollups. The provided data does not explicitly detail the specific utility or functions of the Celestia token (TIA) within this ecosystem.

## Tokenomics
As of the latest data, Celestia has a "total supply" of approximately 1,139,285,061.59 TIA and a "circulating supply" of about 736,070,220.97 TIA. The project's "market cap" stands at $1,179,724,615, with a "fully diluted valuation" of $1,825,970,665. The provided data indicates that there is no explicit "max supply" defined, nor is it explicitly stated as "infinite," suggesting that the maximum supply may not be hard-capped or is subject to future governance decisions not detailed here. Information regarding the token's distribution among the team, investors, or community, as well as specific inflationary or deflationary mechanisms, is not available in the provided fundamental data.

## Team & Roadmap

## Bittensor
### Fundamental Analysis


# Bittensor (TAO) Fundamental Analysis

## Project Summary
Bittensor is an open-source protocol establishing a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. It aims to create a "pure market for artificial intelligence" where machine learning models collaboratively train and are rewarded in TAO tokens based on the informational value they contribute. The project seeks to address the limitations of traditional, centralized AI development by enabling open access, decentralized governance, and the harnessing of globally-distributed computing power and innovation within an incentivized framework. It envisions an open-source repository of machine intelligence accessible to anyone, fostering permission-less innovation and allowing researchers to directly monetize their work.

## Technology & Use Case
Bittensor's core technology is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers that continuously and asynchronously share machine intelligence representations. Models are ranked for their informational production, irrespective of the specific task or dataset used for training. This ranking system, recorded on a digital ledger, incentivizes high-ranking peers with monetary rewards in TAO, which also grants external access to the network's information.

The use case is compelling as it directly addresses the centralization of AI development and the difficulty for individual engineers to monetize their work. By creating a market for intelligence, Bittensor aims to reward diverse and niche AI systems, which might otherwise be overlooked in a "winner-take-all" competition focused on narrow, state-of-the-art objectives.

To ensure network integrity and prevent collusion, Bittensor employs a sophisticated incentive mechanism:
*   **Peer-Ranking**: Peers learn the value of their neighbors and set weights based on the signals produced by other peers.
*   **Consensus Mechanism**: The system is designed to resist collusion by limiting rewards to peers who have not reached consensus within the network, meaning they must attract votes from the majority of stake holders. This mechanism ensures that the majority of token inflation is distributed towards peers with majority consensus.
*   **Bonds**: A speculation-based reward system where peers accumulate "bonds" in other peers they rank. This mechanism incentivizes peers to accurately speculate on the future value and performance of other models, as accumulating bonds in highly valued peers leads to increased inflation for the bondholder.

For interoperability, Bittensor requires a common encoding of inputs and outputs through "tensor standardization." The network initially supports a "TEXT" modality and plans to expand to include "IMAGE," "SPEECH," and "TENSOR" modalities, eventually bridging into multi-modality by combining these (e.g., "TEXT-IMAGE").

## Tokenomics
Bittensor's native token is TAO. The tokenomics are as follows:
*   **Total Supply**: 21,000,000 TAO
*   **Max Supply**: 21,000,000 TAO
*   **Circulating Supply**: 9,597,491 TAO

The network employs an inflationary mechanism where newly minted TAO tokens (referred to as "stake" or "inflation") are distributed as rewards. High-ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network, and this distribution of stake serves as an incentive for peers who contribute to minimizing the network's loss objective. The bond mechanism further influences this distribution, rewarding peers who have accurately speculated on the future value of other peers by accumulating bonds in them. The provided data does not specify the initial distribution of tokens to the team or investors.

## Team & Roadmap
The provided data does not offer specific details regarding the Bittensor team's background, apart from "Yuma Rao" being listed as the author of the whitepaper. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the team's background is not possible based on the given information.

The roadmap, as outlined in the whitepaper, focuses on the technical evolution and expansion of the network's capabilities:
*   **Network Operation**: The whitepaper details the steps for running a peer in the network, including defining datasets, broadcasting examples, learning weights, submitting changes, and the chain measuring loss and distributing stake.
*   **Modality Expansion**: The network plans to expand beyond its initial "TEXT" modality to include "IMAGE," "SPEECH," and "TENSOR" modalities. Future ambitions include supporting combinations of these modalities (e.g., "TEXT-IMAGE") to create a multi-modality landscape, with incentives integrated to connect these different modalities.

While specific timelines or traditional roadmap milestones are not provided, the outlined technical progression indicates a clear vision for the network's development towards a more comprehensive and versatile AI market.

### Proof
- Bittensor is an open-source protocol that powers a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. Machine learning models train collaboratively and are rewarded in TAO according to the informational value they offer the collective. TAO also grants external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while tuning its activities to their needs. Ultimately, BitTensors vision is to create a pure market for artificial intelligence, an incentivized arena in which consumers and producers of this valuable commodity can interact in a trustless, open and transparent context.
- We propose a market where intelligence is priced by other intelligence systems peer-to-peer across the internet.
- The result is a collectively run intelligence market that continually produces newly trained models and pays contributors who create information theoretic value.
- The production of machine intelligence has come to rely almost entirely on a system of benchmarking, where machine learning models are trained to perform well on narrowly defined supervised problems. While this system works well for pushing the performance on these specific problems, the mechanism is weak in situations where the introduction of markets would enable it to excel.
- Standalone engineers cannot directly monetize their work and what results is centralization where a small set of large corporations control access to the best artificial intelligence (OpenAI [2020]).
- A new commodity needs a new type of market (` 1 `). This paper suggests a framework in which machine intelligence is measured by other intelligence systems. Models are ranked for informational production regardless of the subjective task or dataset used to train them.
- An open-source repository of machine intelligence, accessible to anyone, anywhere, thus creating the conditions for open and permission-less innovation on a global internet scale.
- Researchers can directly monetize machine intelligence work and consumers can directly purchase it.
- Our network is composed of n functions F = f 0 ,. f n \ F = f_{0},. f_{n} \: F = f 0 ,. f n peers where each is holding zero or more network weight S = [ s i ] \ S = [s_{i}] \: S = [ s i ] stake represented on a digital ledger.
- Peers rank each other by training neural networks which learn the value of their neighbors. Scores accumulate on a digital ledger where high ranking peers are monetarily rewarded with additional weight in the network.
- The solution is an incentive mechanism that maximally rewards honestly selected weights, making the system resistant to collusion of up to 50 percent of the network weight.
- We extended the naive ranking method to evade collusion with an incentive function I ( W , S ) \ I(W, S) \: I ( W , S ) which limits reward to peers that have not reached consensus in the network.
- Assuming no group of peers holds more than the majority of stake in the system, then peers can only attain inflation by working to attract votes from the majority: a core assumption in many decentralized systems like Bitcoin.
- We introduce these incentives by adapting the inflation mechanism with a speculation based reward in the form of bonds B.
- Like market based speculation on traditional equities, the peers that have accumulated bonds in peers that others will later value attain increased inflation themselves.
- A common encoding of inputs and outputs is required for the various model types and input types to interact. The use of tensor modalities can be used to partition the network into disjoint graphs. At the beginning, the network can be seeded with a single modality TEXT, then expanded to include IMAGE, SPEECH, and TENSOR. Eventually, combinations of these modalities can be added; for instance TEXT-IMAGE, to bridge the network into the multi-modality landscape.

# Technical Analysis Reports
## Ribbita by virtuals
### Trend Analysis
The price of Ribbita by Virtuals initially showed a downtrend, with price below moving averages. A significant bullish shift occurred around 2025-04-16, when the 13-period EMA crossed above the 21-period SMA (Golden Cross), and the price moved above both moving averages. This initiated a sustained uptrend that lasted until late June. On 2025-06-26, the EMA crossed below the SMA (Death Cross), and the price fell below both, indicating a bearish reversal. However, a new bullish trend has emerged recently, with the price crossing back above both the EMA and SMA around 2025-07-22, followed by the EMA crossing above the SMA (another Golden Cross) on the same day. Since then, the price has consistently remained above both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with the EMA maintaining its position above the SMA, confirming a strong and sustained uptrend in the most recent period.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for Ribbita by Virtuals has shown significant movement throughout the observed period. Initially, on 2025-04-08, the RSI was at 10.09, indicating the asset was deeply oversold. It then steadily climbed, entering overbought territory (>70) multiple times in May (e.g., 70.29 on 2025-05-10, 74.69 on 2025-05-16, 75.42 on 2025-05-23, 74.81 on 2025-05-28). After a period of fluctuating within the neutral range (30-70) through June and most of July, the RSI has recently surged again. As of the latest data points in early August, the RSI is firmly in the overbought region (e.g., 73.72 on 2025-08-05, 74.60 on 2025-08-06), signaling strong upward momentum and potential for a pullback.

### Volume Analysis
Volume data for Ribbita by Virtuals shows periods of both confirmation and contradiction. Early in the data, significant volume spikes on 2025-03-28 (11.1M) and 2025-04-03 (12.2M) confirmed sharp price declines, indicating strong selling pressure. During the uptrend in May, while price increased, volume was often moderate, suggesting a lack of strong conviction behind some of the rallies. However, the recent price surge from late July into August has been accompanied by notably increasing volume. For instance, the price jump on 2025-07-30 (5.5M volume) and the continued ascent into early August (e.g., 3.6M volume on 2025-08-06) are supported by significant trading activity. This recent increase in volume confirms the current bullish price action, lending credibility to the upward trend.

### Outlook
Ribbita by Virtuals is currently exhibiting a strong bullish technical outlook. The price is in a clear uptrend, consistently trading above both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, reinforced by a recent Golden Cross. Momentum is robust, with the RSI deeply in overbought territory, indicating significant buying pressure. Furthermore, the recent price appreciation is well-supported by increasing trading volume, suggesting conviction behind the current upward movement. While the overbought RSI might suggest a potential for a near-term consolidation or pullback, the overall confluence of indicators points to a strong bullish phase.

## Aixbt
### Trend Analysis
The price of aixbt experienced a significant uptrend from late November 2024 to early January 2025, with the price consistently trading above its 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). A golden cross (EMA crossing above SMA) occurred around 2025-07-10, signaling a potential shift to an uptrend. However, this bullish momentum was short-lived. A death cross, where the 13-period EMA crossed below the 21-period SMA, occurred recently on 2025-07-29. Since this crossover, the price has consistently traded below both its EMA and SMA, with the EMA remaining below the SMA, confirming a clear bearish trend in the most recent data.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) for aixbt has been in a neutral range for much of the observed period. However, in the most recent data, specifically from late July 2025, the RSI has shown a clear declining trend, moving from the mid-40s towards the low 30s. The latest RSI values are hovering just above the oversold threshold of 30, indicating weakening buying momentum and increasing selling pressure.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for aixbt has shown significant activity during periods of strong price movements. The initial sharp price increase in late 2024 and subsequent rallies in January and late April 2025 were confirmed by substantial volume spikes, indicating strong buying conviction. In the most recent period, corresponding with the price decline from late July to early August 2025, volume has remained moderate to high. This sustained volume during the downward price action suggests that the selling pressure is accompanied by continued conviction, rather than a lack of interest or liquidity.

### Outlook
The technical analysis for aixbt indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment in the most recent period. The price has consistently traded below its key moving averages, which have themselves formed a bearish crossover (death cross). Momentum, as measured by the RSI, is weakening and approaching oversold conditions, further supporting the downside. The sustained moderate to high volume during this decline suggests that sellers are acting with conviction. Overall, the current technical outlook for aixbt is bearish, with no immediate signs of a reversal based on the provided data.

## Paal ai
### Trend Analysis
PAAL AI's price has been in a clear downtrend in the latter part of the provided data. The price has consistently traded below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA). A bearish crossover occurred around 2025-07-19 to 2025-07-20, where the EMA crossed below the SMA, and this bearish alignment has largely persisted. As of the last data point (2025-08-06), the price (0.0943) is significantly below the EMA (0.1034) and the SMA (0.1111), reinforcing the established bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI for PAAL AI peaked in overbought territory at 70.47 on 2025-07-23. Since then, the RSI has been on a declining trend, moving from overbought levels into the neutral range. As of the last data point (2025-08-06), the RSI stands at 41.92, indicating that momentum is currently neutral but has been weakening following the recent price decline.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume for PAAL AI has shown patterns that largely confirm the recent price movements. Significant volume spikes were observed during periods of sharp price increases (e.g., 2025-07-22 and 2025-07-23) and also during some notable price declines (e.g., 2025-07-28, 2025-07-29, 2025-08-02), indicating conviction behind these moves. However, recent attempts at price recovery (e.g., 2025-08-04, 2025-08-05) were not accompanied by proportionally strong volume, suggesting a lack of robust buying conviction. The overall trend in volume has been decreasing in the most recent data points, alongside the price decline, which generally confirms the weakening price action.

### Outlook
PAAL AI is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The price has consistently traded below both its EMA and SMA, with a recent bearish crossover of the EMA below the SMA confirming the downtrend. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has cooled significantly from overbought conditions and is now in a neutral range, reflecting the recent price depreciation. Volume analysis generally confirms the downtrend, with notable spikes accompanying price declines and a lack of strong volume conviction during minor price recoveries. This combination of bearish trend indicators, weakening momentum, and confirming volume suggests continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.

## Bittensor
### Trend Analysis
The overall trend for Bittensor is bearish. The price has consistently traded below both its 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the latter part of the data series. A significant bearish crossover, often referred to as a 'death cross', occurred around 2025-07-31, where the EMA (406.14) crossed below the SMA (412.52). Since this crossover, both moving averages have been trending downwards, and the price remains below them, reinforcing the prevailing downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has recently moved from the lower end of the neutral range, approaching oversold conditions, to a slight rebound. Specifically, the RSI dropped from 50.239 on 2025-07-29 to a low of 34.119 on 2025-08-03. In the last two data points (2025-08-04 and 2025-08-05), the RSI has increased to 39.892 and 42.550 respectively, indicating a minor recovery in momentum but remaining within the neutral zone and not yet signaling strong bullish momentum or overbought conditions.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis indicates that the recent bearish price action was initially confirmed by increased selling pressure. For instance, the price drop on 2025-08-02 from 353.2599 to 343.8472 was accompanied by a notable increase in volume from 121.96 million to 185.63 million, confirming the conviction behind the decline. However, the subsequent minor price increases on 2025-08-04 and 2025-08-05 (from 334.205 to 350.0992 and then to 357.8907) were accompanied by relatively lower volumes (94.11 million and 95.95 million respectively), suggesting that these upward movements lack strong buying conviction and may represent a temporary rebound rather than a sustained reversal.

### Outlook
Bittensor is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook based on the provided data. The price is trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with a recent bearish crossover (death cross) confirming the downtrend. While momentum indicators show a slight rebound from near oversold levels, they remain in the lower neutral range, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction. The recent price declines were initially confirmed by higher volume, and the subsequent minor price increases have not been supported by significant volume, indicating that current upward movements may lack sustainability. Overall, the technical signals point towards continued downward pressure or consolidation in the near term.

## Near protocol

The price has consistently traded below both the 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the most recent days. A significant bearish crossover, often referred to as a 'death cross', occurred on 2025-08-01, where the 13-period EMA (2.7357) crossed below the 21-period SMA (2.7567). This bearish alignment of the moving averages has persisted, with the EMA (2.6048) remaining below the SMA (2.7412) as of the last data point (2025-08-05), reinforcing the prevailing downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI has been in the neutral range (between 30 and 70) throughout the recent period. It dropped from levels around 53-52 to a low of 37.83 on 2025-08-03. Subsequently, the RSI has shown a slight recovery, increasing to 47.77 on 2025-08-05, moving away from the oversold threshold but remaining well within the neutral zone. This indicates a lack of strong bullish or bearish momentum.

### Volume Analysis
Volume analysis reveals a notable increase in selling pressure during the recent price declines. Specifically, on 2025-08-02, a significant volume spike of 352.45 million was observed as the price continued its downward movement, confirming the conviction behind the selling. In contrast, the subsequent minor price increases on 2025-08-04 and 2025-08-05 were accompanied by relatively lower volumes (101.34 million and 142.52 million respectively), suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support a sustained upward price reversal.

### Outlook
NEAR Protocol is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The price is trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, which are themselves in a bearish alignment following a death cross on 2025-08-01. The momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is neutral, showing some recovery from lower levels but not signaling strong bullish conviction. Volume analysis confirms the recent price decline with a significant spike in selling volume, while subsequent minor price increases have been on comparatively lower volume, suggesting weak buying interest. The overall technical picture points to continued bearish pressure with no clear signs of a reversal.

## Internet computer

On 2025-07-22, the price was above both the 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with the EMA also above the SMA. However, from 2025-07-24, the price dropped below both moving averages. A bearish crossover, commonly known as a death cross, occurred around 2025-07-30, where the 13-period EMA (5.6220) crossed below the 21-period SMA (5.6207). Since this crossover, the price has consistently remained below both moving averages, and the EMA has stayed below the SMA, confirming a sustained bearish trend.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI reached overbought territory (70.78) on 2025-07-22, indicating a peak in bullish momentum. Subsequently, the RSI sharply declined, falling to a low of 37.66 on 2025-08-03. As of the latest data point (2025-08-05), the RSI is at 44.22, which is within the neutral range (30-70) but below 50, suggesting a lack of strong buying momentum.

### Volume Analysis
The price surge that led to the peak on 2025-07-22 was accompanied by relatively high trading volumes (e.g., 116.27 million on 2025-07-22 and 124.30 million on 2025-07-23). The subsequent significant price drop on 2025-07-24 (from 6.1141 to 5.599) was confirmed by a high volume of 117.39 million, indicating strong selling pressure. In the most recent days (2025-08-04 and 2025-08-05), despite a slight price recovery, the trading volumes have been comparatively lower (34.08 million and 48.93 million respectively), suggesting a lack of strong conviction or renewed buying interest to support a significant upward movement.

### Outlook
Internet Computer is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The price is trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, with a bearish crossover (death cross) of the EMA below the SMA occurring around 2025-07-30, reinforcing the downtrend. Momentum, as indicated by the RSI, has shifted from overbought conditions to a neutral range below 50, suggesting a lack of strong bullish conviction. While initial price declines were confirmed by high volume, recent minor price increases have been on comparatively lower volume, failing to signal strong buying interest. The combined evidence from trend, momentum, and volume indicators points towards continued downward pressure or consolidation in the short-to-medium term.

## Artificial superintelligence alliance
### Trend Analysis

A 'death cross' occurred around October 4, 2024, where the 13-period EMA (1.511) crossed below the 21-period SMA (1.518). Since this crossover, the EMA has largely remained below the SMA, and the price has consistently traded below both moving averages, confirming the bearish trend.

In the most recent period (late July to early August 2025), the RSI trended downwards from 46.66 to 34.99, indicating weakening momentum. A slight recovery was observed in the last two data points, with the RSI rising to 43.98, but it remains in the lower half of the neutral zone, not signaling overbought or oversold conditions.

### Volume Analysis
Trading volume has shown varied patterns. During significant price declines, such as from late July to early August 2025, increased volume (e.g., 194M on July 29, 147M on August 2) confirmed the selling pressure and conviction behind the downward price movements. Conversely, the recent minor price increases on August 4 and 5 (from 0.6166 to 0.6666) were accompanied by comparatively lower volumes (52M and 70M respectively), suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support a sustained upward reversal.

### Outlook
Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is currently in a sustained downtrend, as evidenced by the price consistently trading below both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and the EMA remaining below the SMA since a death cross in early October 2024. Market momentum, as indicated by the RSI, is neutral, with recent slight recoveries lacking strong conviction. The volume analysis further supports this bearish sentiment, as significant selling pressure was confirmed by high volume during price declines, while recent minor price increases have occurred on comparatively lower volume. The overall technical outlook remains bearish, with no clear signs of a reversal based on the provided data.

## Virtuals protocol
### Trend Analysis
From late September 2024 to early January 2025, Virtuals Protocol experienced a strong uptrend, with price consistently trading above both the 13-period EMA and the 21-period SMA. A golden cross occurred around late April 2025, when the 13-period EMA crossed above the 21-period SMA, confirming a renewed upward trend. However, starting from late May 2025, the trend has reversed. The price has consistently traded below both moving averages, and a death cross, where the 13-period EMA crossed below the 21-period SMA, occurred on 2025-06-05. This indicates a current downtrend.

### Momentum Analysis
From late September to late October 2024, the RSI surged into extremely overbought territory, reaching highs above 90 (e.g., 91.19 on 2024-10-17, 96.04 on 2024-10-28), indicating strong buying pressure. Following this, the RSI retreated, entering the neutral range (30-70) and even dipping into oversold territory (<30) in early February 2025 (e.g., 28.95 on 2025-02-03, 27.32 on 2025-02-07). Another significant surge in RSI occurred in late April/early May 2025, pushing it back into overbought conditions (e.g., 84.61 on 2025-05-02, 86.50 on 2025-05-03). Currently, the RSI has been declining since late May 2025, moving from overbought levels through the neutral zone. As of the last data point (2025-08-05), the RSI is at 36.06, which is in the lower neutral range, approaching oversold conditions but not yet there. This indicates weakening momentum.

### Volume Analysis
The initial strong uptrend from late September to late October 2024 was accompanied by massive spikes in trading volume (e.g., 10M+ on 2024-10-17, 63M+ on 2024-10-26), confirming the bullish price action. The significant price increase in late April/early May 2025 was also confirmed by substantial volume spikes (e.g., 526M+ on 2025-04-29, 972M+ on 2025-05-09). However, the recent price decline from late May 2025 onwards has seen consistently high volume, often in the hundreds of millions (e.g., 420M+ on 2025-05-31, 386M+ on 2025-07-18). This high volume during a downtrend suggests strong selling pressure and a conviction in the bearish movement.

### Outlook
Virtuals Protocol is currently exhibiting a bearish technical outlook. The price has recently undergone a death cross, with the 13-period EMA falling below the 21-period SMA on 2025-06-05, and continues to trade below both moving averages, indicating a downtrend. Momentum, as measured by the RSI, has significantly cooled from previously overbought conditions and is now in the lower neutral range, approaching oversold, suggesting weakening buying interest. The high trading volume observed during the recent price declines confirms the conviction behind the bearish movement, indicating significant selling pressure.

## Iotex

### Volume Analysis

High volumes continued on 2025-08-01 (49.60M) and 2025-08-02 (54.36M) as the price maintained its ascent. Although volume saw a temporary decrease on 2025-08-03 and 2025-08-04, it picked up again on 2025-08-05 (17.71M) and remained robust on 2025-08-06 (21.52M and 20.30M), confirming sustained market participation and conviction behind the upward price movements.

### Outlook

## Lido staked ether
### Trend Analysis
The data shows that Lido Staked Ether experienced a strong uptrend from early November 2024 through late July 2025, with the price consistently trading above both its 13-period EMA and 21-period SMA, and the EMA generally remaining above the SMA. However, a significant bearish crossover occurred around 2025-08-02, where the 13-period EMA (3633.37) crossed below the 21-period SMA (3546.23). Following this crossover, the price has generally traded below both moving averages. The latest data point on 2025-08-06 shows the price (3585.50) below the EMA (3599.92) and the SMA (3658.49), with the EMA remaining below the SMA, indicating a confirmed short-term downtrend or a period of consolidation after the previous rally.

### Momentum Analysis
The 14-period RSI was consistently in overbought territory (above 70) from mid-July until August 1st, peaking at 87.41 on July 21st and 22nd, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, since August 1st, the RSI has sharply declined from overbought levels (66.60 on August 1st) into the neutral zone, currently standing at 55.72 and 55.73 on August 6th (duplicate entry). This significant decrease in RSI suggests a substantial loss of bullish momentum and a shift towards more balanced or potentially bearish momentum in the very short term. The recent trend shows the RSI decreasing.

### Volume Analysis
The strong price uptrend observed in mid-July was generally confirmed by robust and often increasing trading volumes, including significant spikes on dates like 2025-07-17 (111.6M), 2025-07-18 (178.5M), 2025-07-19 (196.8M), and 2025-07-21 (141.4M), suggesting strong buying interest. However, the recent price declines on August 2nd (price dropped from 3693.49 to 3480.17) were accompanied by high volume (95.8M), confirming the bearish move. Subsequent attempts at price recovery on August 4th and 5th saw moderate volume (49.2M and 61.0M respectively), which did not match the conviction seen during the earlier strong rallies or recent declines, indicating a potential lack of strong buying conviction at current levels. The latest data point on August 6th shows a further price drop on moderate volume (38.0M), reinforcing the lack of strong buying pressure.

### Outlook
Lido Staked Ether has recently transitioned from a strong bullish phase to a more bearish or consolidating short-term outlook. The bearish crossover of the 13-period EMA below the 21-period SMA around August 2nd, coupled with a significant drop in the 14-period RSI from extended overbought levels into the neutral zone, points to a clear loss of upward momentum. The volume analysis confirms the recent downward price movements, while showing less conviction for recent upward attempts. This combined evidence suggests that the asset may continue to face downward pressure or consolidate in the near term as it digests the previous strong rally.

## Internet computer
### Trend Analysis
The price of Internet Computer has been consistently trading below both its 13-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 21-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the most recent data. A bearish crossover, where the 13-period EMA crossed below the 21-period SMA, occurred around 2025-07-30, further confirming the established downtrend. This indicates that short-term prices are declining faster than longer-term averages.

### Momentum Analysis

It showed a declining trend from approximately 50.09 on 2025-07-29 to a low of 37.66 on 2025-08-03, indicating weakening momentum. Subsequently, it has seen a slight rebound to 44.22 by 2025-08-05, but remains well within the neutral zone and has not entered overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) territory.

### Volume Analysis
Recent price declines, specifically on 2025-08-01, were accompanied by a notable increase in volume (from 62.7 million to 93.1 million), which confirms selling pressure and conviction in the downward movement. Conversely, the minor price increases observed on 2025-08-04 and 2025-08-05 occurred on comparatively lower volumes (34.0 million and 48.9 million respectively) when compared to earlier periods of higher volume, suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction for the recent upward price movements.

### Outlook
The technical analysis for Internet Computer, based on the provided data, indicates a prevailing bearish sentiment. The price is consistently below its key moving averages, which have recently confirmed a bearish crossover. While the RSI is not in oversold territory, its recent decline suggests weakening momentum. Furthermore, the volume analysis points to conviction in recent downward price movements and a lack of strong buying interest during minor price rebounds. The combined signals suggest that the bearish trend is likely to persist in the short term.

However, the subsequent slight price increases on August 4th and 5th occurred on lower or relatively flat volume (94M and 95M), suggesting a lack of strong buying conviction to support a sustained upward reversal.

### Outlook
